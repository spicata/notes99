When there is a greater volume, gas particles will have less chance to hit each other or hit walls, and so the pressure decreases. Or in a sense, the forces will stay the same but the area will increase, and so the pressure will decrease (as the formula). The reverse is true.
- Boyle's Law: at a given temperature, the **V**olume of a given mass of gas in inversely proportional to the **P**ressure.
- PV = k, where k is a constant
- Alternatively, P1V1 = P2V2, where x1 is initial and x2 is final.
- Systems like to be constant, so if a change is made, it will try to revert to its original state
