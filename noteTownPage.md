dear the town members (and to anyone else this page finds),

i have read some of your town pages, and they are very good, and i am proud as a mayor[^1] that you guys upload quality content. but you know... the town analogy is meant to be a fun little analogy that loosely explain what we are doing. there is no need to take it so seriously. feel free to go ham on your town page, it is nothing official (luckily). diss other members[^2], put in jokes, have some fun, it's your website anyways. of course, if you don't want to, you don't need to, but why not.



[^1]: HA. i jest, i am not the mayor :-)
[^2]: edward has a wife, and her name is [redacted] (but you know her)
