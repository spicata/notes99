Avert your gaze to the diagram from [kinetics](kinetics.md):

```
Temperature
 ^                /
 |               /
 |      --------     <- state change (e.g. melting)
 |    --
 |  --
 |--
-+-----------------> Heat
 |
```

What is up with the flat sections? There is no change in temperature => there is no change in kinetic energy. So potential energy must be the thing that is changing. i.e. bonds are forming/breaking.

$$Q=mL_{v}\text{ or }Q=mL_{f}$$

Lv is the latent heat of vaporisation i.e. liquid to gas or vice-versa. For water, it is 2.26x10^6 J pkg. Lf is the latent heat of fusion i.e. solid to liquid or vice-versa. For water, 3.34x10^5 J pkg.
