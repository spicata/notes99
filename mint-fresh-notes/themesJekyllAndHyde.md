## sub-human

hyde is often seen as almost sub-human or monkeyish in a sense. this may have been because of charle's darwins recent discoveries on the process of evolution, and the idea that humans are animals were not that different, as they came from the same ancestors. this led to the fear that if it were possible for humans to evolve from monkeys, it would also be possible for humans to devolve into monkeys. this fear of giving into our primal urges is a key part of jekyll and hyde, and it acts as the backbone of it's conflict. this novel is about the conflict between humanity and primalism.

hyde can be seen as the "primality" of jekyll. he is brutish, angry, unsocialable, and impulsive. he is not bound by the laws of societies and does so as he wills. this at first is a freeing experience for jekyll, but as time goes on, we come to learn tha tthese social laws are integral to a functioning human being, without them we become a monster.

### satanic

hyde is also often likened to satan, showing him as the pure embodiment of evil that lived with jekyll. this could be referring to how all of us house a little satan within ourselves, and that the primal instincts we feel are the preciptation of this evil. this could be seen in the context of victorian society. During this time, people were "austere", there was a strict social law, and those who went against it were 'evil'.

there was a harsh binary between 'good' and 'evil', and those who did not succumb to their desires would be seen as 'good'. jekyll and hyde challenges this division, saying that they exist in coesxistence.

### id

jekyll and hyde could also be understood from a freudian perspective. freud, the creator of psychoanalysis, was concerned primarily about what he believed was the 'unconscious mind', the belief that a part of us operated in the background without our own realisation. he posited that this unconscious was influenced by all the feelings and desires we had repressed, usually during childhood, and that although these seemed to be forgotten, they would still play a role in our lives and fears from the unconscious.

there was the idea that there were three entities in the human mind, the id, the ego, and the superego. the id was the instictual part of our brain. it wanted to do what it desires away from the bounds of society. the superego on the other hand was the supreme morality, it would adhere only to social laws. the ego was the middle-man, and it was the part that would weigh up both sides and choose. within jekyll and hyde, we can see hyde as the id, a part of jekyll that goes around doing what it pleases with no remorse when he hurts others. in a sense, jekyll can be seen as both the ego and the superego, as he used to act as the controller of his own actions, and once separated, would be the person who would be disgusted by hyde's actions. however, we can comment that the character of 'superergo' is not truly realised in jekyll and hyde, and this is acknolwedged by jekyll, stating that if he were to go into this experiment with nobler goals (separating superego from himself so that it can go around doing good), then the result may have been different.

another key psychoanalytical 'trope' is the idea the, when we dream, the unconscious is finally released, and that our fears and locked away feelings are realised in a dream. we can see this when jekyll often wakes up from dreams as hyde, and where utterson dreams of the mystery of hyde, a very pressing issue that concerns him greatly. jekyll waking up as hyde could be the precipitation of his unconscious desires into its full state, and this finally taking over his life.

## a mirror of victorian society

a key part of victorian society is that it was highly concerned with public image. so much so that they would have essentially different identities for their public life and other one for their private life. this can be vaguely seen with utterson and enfield, whom both have their own desires and feelings, but conceals them to become the model victorian citizen. however, of course, this is most pronounced in jekyll, who goes as far as to create literally a new identity for his private life, using 'jekyll' as merely his public life.

this is almost entirely a reflection of victorian society, whose citizens were so concerned with their status and reputation, which is what causes hyde to be such a compelling villian, as it reflects in inner conflict within the reader. this would be a common theme within gothic literature; the heroes would not be perfect and its villains would reveal the deepest and darkest flaws within humanity.

however, it is the distinction between the public and private life that eventually leads to the death of jekyll, as his treatment of jekyll as a mere shell of his true self leads to his adoption of hyde as his true self, which in turn leads to his demise.

the text also shows a possible one-sided-ness of this private and public life, wherein the private life conceals hidden desires, and this one-sideness comes into play as only hyde, jekyll's evil side, is ever condensed.[^1]

## science

science boomed during the industrial revolution, and of course with that, came skepticism. people were skeptical of the goodwill of science, and this led to a general kind of distrust of science, which we see in jekyll and hyde. enfield not only refers to a doctor as "sawbones", but science is also seen as a destructive tool, and jekyll is seemingly punished for his hubris in trying to alter the "god-designed" human body. the use of science is a common gothic feature, and this distrust in it kind of rings throughout texts during this time, such as in the romantic movement as well.

## challenging whatsit called

jekyll and hyde also challenges the (whatsit called the uh) dichotomy that victorians were so engaged in. dichotomy is the belief that two concepts are completely opposed to each other: it is either this, or it is that. good or bad, pure or evil, man or woman, stuff like that. obviously jekyll and hyde himself as a character challenges this idea, is shows that humans can be both seemingly good and definitely bad at the same time, that there are more than one human inside a human. he is this mix.

utterson is also kind of a mix. he is kind of... let's say stale, however he also has stuff that he enjoys.

## spirituality

victorian society was very religious, but also decreasingly religious
