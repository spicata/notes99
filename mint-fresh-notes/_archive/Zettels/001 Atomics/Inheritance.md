# Inheritance
## Autosomal Inheritance
An allele on an autosome that is inherited is known as autosomal inheritance
### Autosomal Traits
An autosomal trait is a that is inherited in the autosome (See [[Chromosomes]]).
### Recessive
People who carry one recessive defective allele in the pair of alleles are called of carriers.
### Dominant
A dominant allele will never "skip" a generation.
If both parents are homozygous affected, all children with all be affected.
## Sex-linked Inheritance
### Sex-linked Traits
A sex-linked trait is a trait that is inherited in the sex chromosomes.
It is usually on the X sex chromosome, as the Y sex chromosome is extremely short
### X-linked
#### Recessive
Patterns:
- A father cannot give a recessive X-linked traits to his son
- Recessive X-linked traits are more prevelant in males
- Recessive X-linked are likely to skip generations. 
## Carriers
People who carry one recessive defective allele in the pair of alleles are called of carriers.
