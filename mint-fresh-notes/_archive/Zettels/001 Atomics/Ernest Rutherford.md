# Ernest Rutherford
```ad-tldr

Rutherford found that most of the mass of an atom was focused on a small point in the middle. This was known as the nucleus.

```
He did this by firing alpha partices at a gold foil.
He found that most of the time, the alpha particle would pass through, however, this was not always the case.
He concluded that there must be a small point in the atom where most of the mass is stored.
