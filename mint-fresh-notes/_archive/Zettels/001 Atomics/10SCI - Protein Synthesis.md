# 10SCI - Protein Synthesis
**Same as [[10SCI - Transcription and Translation]]**
1. In the nucleus, ONE gene unwinds when RNA polymerase attaches - seperating the two strands
2. The non-coding, template strand is used to create mRNA
3. RNA polymerase adds nucleotides complementry to the DNA in a 5' to 3' direction
4. DNA : RNA
	1. Adenine -> Uracil
	2. Thymine -> Adenine
	3. Cytosine <-> Guanine
5. Premature mRNA goes through splicing: introns are removed, exons joins. Mature mRNA exists via nuclear pores.
6. mRNA attaches to ribosome; start codon first to be read.
7. tRNA transports anticodon complementry to next codon inside ribosome. Simultaneously, tRNA transports the amino acid specified by the codon.
8. Chain of amino acid grow connected by peptide bonds -> polypeptide dettaches + joins another polypeptide and folds.
