# 10SCI - Mutation
A mutation is a source of new alleles in a population's gene pool.
```ad-Definition

A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence of a gene. A mutation can change on allele to another, but the net effect is a change in the frequency of a existing allele.

```
The change in frequency is often insignificant.
## Selection pressure
A selection pressure is an environmental factor that can be survived by those individuals in a population who possess a beneficial trait, but not others.
```ad-example

- Presence of food/prey/shelter (resources)
- Temperature, water availability, pH (abiotic factors)
- Pathogens, diseases, and predators (biotic factors)

```
## Types
### Location
#### Germ-line
Mutations that affect gamete cells. These mutations can be passed onto an individual's offspring.
#### Somatics
Mutation that affect somatic cells. These mutations can't be passed onto an individual's offspring.
### Size
#### Point
A point mutation is a mutation that affects on the scale of nucleotides.
These usually happen with only a single nucleotides.
##### Substitution
##### Addition
##### Deletion
#### Chromosome
A chromosome mutation is a mutation that affects on the scale of a section or whole chromosomes.
It affects an entire gene or even several genes.
##### Deletion
##### Inversion
##### Translocation
##### Duplication
## Causes
### Errors
Occurs during DNA replication and during cell division (Mitosis and Meiosis).
Usually, errors in DNA are fixed instantly, however, there are occasions where they do happen.
### Mutagens
#### Physical Factors
Causes of mutation that is related to physical sciences. e.g. radiation
#### Chemical Factors
Causes of mutation that is related to chemicals. e.g. mustard gas
#### Biological Factors
Causes of mutation that is related to biological factors. e.g. bacterial plasmids,
