# 10SCI - Alleles
Alleles are different forms of the same gene. e.g. A purple flower allele and a white flower allele. A pair of alleles are found on a maternal and parental homologous chromosome.
## Dominant Allele
The dominant allele always expresses itself in the phenotype.
There is no difference if it is paired with either another dominant or a recessive allele.
## Recessive Allele
The recessive allele is hidden by the dominant allele, and only shows if it is paired with another recessive allele.
## Pure Breed
In a pure breed, the pair of alleles are the same. (Literally just homozygous)
## Homozygous
Homozygous means to have two identical alleles in a pair.
## Heterozygous
Heterozygous means to have two different alleles in a pair.
Due to the nature of the dominant allele, it is always the one that is expressed.
