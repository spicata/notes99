### Body Paragrah 2: Anti-war message

3. *“And not one will know of the war, not one

3. Allusion & Repetition
	1. The name of this text is an allusion to *There Will Come Soft Rains* by Sara Teasdale, and it includes the poem itself. The poem written by Sara Teasdale shows a world after the extinction of humanity, and shows how a great war was the cause. This poem also has some anti-war messaging, but is greatly overshadowed by the human irrelavancy in the universe.
	2. The repetition of *"not one"* shows the utter annihilation of the human race through war.
4. Connotation & Symbolism
	1. The use of titanic in *"one titanic instant"* shows the sudden destruction that nuclear weaponary can bring.

#### Techniques
1. Personification

2. Analogy
	1. Lots to unpack

	3. The fire is similar to an elephant, as an unstoppable and giant foe.
	4. The house, on the other hand, is likened to a dead snake, although it may seem deadly, it has no power.
	5. Also foreshadowing the house's eventual demise, a truly dead snake.
3. Visual Imagery & Metaphor
	1. Green? Shows its unnaturalness against the fire
	2. The chemicals are a venom of sorts to the fire, and the house is using it to defend itself.
4. Simile & Syntax
	1. *"The dog was gone"* is straight to the point,
	2. Simile of *"blown gray leaves in an electrical wind"* shows how technology is being made to replace nature with analogous parts.
