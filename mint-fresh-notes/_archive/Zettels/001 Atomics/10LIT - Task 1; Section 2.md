# 10LIT - Task 1; Section 2
A lower-class miner attempts to create safety and stability in his job and life, so that he can continue to support his family, but everything goes awry when a string of tragedies befall him.

## Things that happen:
- He attempts to get on good term with his boss, instead boss sees his desperation and decreases his pay, as he will continue to work nonetheless
- Beloved family member (probably elderly) dies (or is sick), family is torn between doing nothing (letting them die) due to lack of money or to arrange a funeral (get medicine/doctors), fueling division in the family
- Attempts to get a larger (and good) house for the family goes south when another family offers to pay more
- Family member caught pickpocketing (from desperation), loses job or is fined.
- Grows more and more sick due to working in the mines, but continues to support family. Eventually cannot keep up, and is fired, children having to fill in the role to earn the family money.
## Notes:
- Narrator takes an active voice in the story, as in The Warden and Oliver Twist
- Narrator gives exposition on the character?
- Or it is purely objective as in Bleak House
## Setting:
- Industrial City
- Filled with smog, smoke escaping chimneys of houses and factories
- Cars, horses, people all mixing together in the streets
- Filth-covered and tired miners walking around, carrying the smell of brimstone
- Itâ€™s England, so, it's rainy
- Try to emulate the style of the Bleak House, highly descriptive exposition. Do that for about a paragraph or two.
- Bleak House introduces character by showing where they are, and then by describing their personality or something.

| Worker Rights | Workers, being the backbone of modern society, as well as an invaluable part of our community, should not be disregarded and afforded rights.      |
| Poverty       | Society should cooperate with each other as well as governments and other organisations to aid those in poverty, as it brings ruin to their lives. |

Dark, heavy drops of dirty rain fell from the sky, as ~~dark~~ looming clouds covered the already ~~dark~~ sky, obscuring any rays of light left, as the small town plunged into ~~darkness~~. Smoke disappeared from the chimneys into the cold air, as the occasional dying ember floated out, only to be smited by the ~~rain~~. Passengers, horses, dogs, all blending into the shadows, moving as one congealed mass, squirming, writhing, completely apathetic towards to ~~cold~~ weather. A drunkard or two stumbles and slips on the damp, stone road, causing some commotion. Groups of children, chimney-sweepers, covered head to toe in soot, huddling together for some warmth, entering shops to fill their hungry, empty stomachs.

It was dark, the nearby river, which many had depended on, due to years of ash and smoke, rendering it impossible to drink; parched workers having to resort to cheaper alcohol over water as injuries becoming more common. It was dark, the forest, as soot from the factories covered the trees, suffocating them. It was dark, the hills

The distant clanging of iron picks on the hard, cold, rock grounds reverberate from the mines, down the towns. Several down-troddened, demoralised miners exit out, covered in filth, carrying the scent of brimstone with them. Walking with them was Stanley Conrad, a poverty-ridden coal miner, drenched in sweat which washed away with the downpour, as he mixed into the crowds of foot passengers around him. Conrad was a fine worker, possibly the best of the town, but was bound to the coal mines, unable to secure a more luxurious job. Walking along the dark streets, he peered into the glass windows of shops on either side, knowing that he would be unable to purchase any of the vanities that he found within. Clutching his pay for today in his hand, he would scurry home, as he had every other day, hoping that no trouble would befall him.

Conrad had lived in this town, which would have no name, for his entire life, unable to escape the shackles of his family's debt. Despite his downcomings, he had been able to have a family, of which he worked desperatly, day and night, to keep together. He was an optimistic man, and went to his work everyday, believing that that day might be the day where he would strike gold, and that everything would work out for him. He would have drank away his problems along with his fellow miners, but he lacked the money to do so, as, despite being the most diligent miners in the town, he was never paid equally with his friends, forever keeping him and his family in debt.
