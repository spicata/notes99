# 10LIT - Task 1; Section 1
**Origins**: The Victorian age was a period of literature and art that is commonly agreed to have ranged between 1798 to 1832, overlapping with Queen Victoria's rule. Having had a great influence during this time, the era shares after her name.
Another event that shaped the development of the Victorian age would be the Industrial Revolution, and subsequent development of science and urbanisation, influencing the common themes in literature during this time.
The Victorian age signified a turn from Romantic literature, as it focused more on a objectivism and applied a greater emphasis on the lives of ordinary, middle and low class people at the time. 
This era is often regarded as the Golden Age of English literature, and is characterised by an influx in prose fiction, contrasted to the predominance of poetry in early periods of literature. 

**Prevailing Principles**: Victorian literature commonly depicts the difficulty and hardness of industrial life in which hard work, and perseverance wins in the end. It also explores British Imperialism; work and the middle class; industrliasation; and a pessismism towards religion and spirituality. 

**Figures of importance**: Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde, Anthony Trollope, Mary Ann Evans (under the penname George Eliot)
