# Boomerangs in a Thunderstorm
## Analysis
> Explain how Boomerangs in a Thunderstorm represents an intense moment

The poem *Boomerangs in a Thunderstorm* represents a thunderstorm as an intense moment for the author/narratee. When the narratee states that "The clouds are so low that I imagine a puffy hand, reaching out and sending a boomerang off-course", the strength of the storm is established, and the weather is set up to be an active proponent in this poem. The narrratee also adds that his "lungs are full of the spirits of rain" and that they were "riding the storm", giving life to the storm, and showing their overcoming of challenges that nature provides, and constructs an analogy to the act of riding a wild animal. The reference to "the sacred mountain owl, *Coot-tha Dreaming*" further adds significance to the location, and brings cultural importance to the act of throwing boomerangs in a thunderstorm.
