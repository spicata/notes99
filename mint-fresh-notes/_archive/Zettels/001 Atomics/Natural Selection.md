Natural selection occurs when selection pressures in the environment prefer a selective advantage over a specific phenotype to enhance its survival and reproductions.
It leads to changes in allele frequency in the gene pool of a population.
Individuals that have certain inherited traits are more likely to survive and reproduce at higher rates than other individuals.
## Principles
### Principle 1: Variation
Individuals in a population differ from one another; that is, individual within populations show variation.
### Principle 2: Overproduction
There are more individuals produced in a population than the environment can support. Not all individuals can survive to reproduce. Only occurs when there is a limited resource.
### Principle 3: Competition and Survival of the Fittest
Environmental selection pressures such as food availability, predators, and some diseases favour those with more **advantageous traits/alleles**.
### Principle 4: Higher Reproductive Rate
Individuals that have an advantageous allele are more likely to survive and to reproduce.
### Principle 5: Heritability
Advantageous alleles are heritable.
More likely to pass on alleles.
### Principle 6: Allele Frequency Change
Over consecutive generations, the frequency of the advantageous alles increases.
