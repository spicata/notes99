# 10SCI - Genetic Drift
Almost contrary to natural selection.
Genertic drift occures in all population, but its effects are strongest in small populations. The smaller the population, the faster the fixation of alleles and the extinction of other alleles can occur.
The random changes from generation to generation can be either external or can be internal, as during meiosis.

The second step should say 5:1.

## Extreme Genetic Drift
There are two extreme forms of genetic drift.
### Bottleneck Effect
The bottleneck effect occurs when there is a disaster of some sort that reduces a population to a relatively small number. 
The gene pool of the now smaller population is not reflective of the larger gene pool of the original population.
### Founder Effect
The founder effect occurs when a small population moves to a new area and becomes isolated from the larger population.
The gene pool of the now smaller population is not reflective of the larger gene pool of the original population.
