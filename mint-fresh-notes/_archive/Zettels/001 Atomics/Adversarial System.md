# Adversarial System
In the adversarial system, there exists two parties, and the judge.
The two parties are responsible for presenting their case, whilst the judge is responsible for considering which evidence is admissable and to ensure that the case follows the law.
The judge should always be impartial.
This is usually compared with the [[Inquisitorial System]].
The adversarial system is often more costly, and requires people to spend large sums to aquire better lawyers, while the inquisitorial system is much cheaper.
This problem combined with the system of the common law creates some problems in the creation of the common law, particularly for smaller cases.
