# Claudia Tutoring 1
## Warm-up
### Mental Maths
1. $1+1$
2. $12+5$
3. $27+34$
4. $65-32$
5. $90-35+45$
6. $60\times3$
7. $45\div3$
8. $12\div3\times7$
9. $\sqrt9$
10. $12^2$
### Simple Algebra
1. $x-1=0$
2. $2x=0$
3. $x\div3-2=0$
4. $-x+3=0$
5. $x=x+1$
## Mini-Lesson 1: How to write neatly
- Fold your page in half. One half is dedicated to working out, one is dedicated to calculations
- Lead expressions with equals, lead equations with nothing.
  Expression: $2(x-7)$
  Equation: $2(x-7)=12$
- Write each new step in a new line.
	- **Each line, one step.**
- Align to the right. [^1]
- Try to write neatly
- If you make a mistake, erase it or cross it out.
## Lesson 1: Negative numbers
**Negative numbers are numbers that are smaller than zero.**
In the form: $-x$
e.g. $-1$

### Negative Addition
When considering the number line, adding is essentially pulling to the respective side.
e.g. $-1+2=1$
![[Pasted image 20220403092124.png]]
We can see it shifted towards to positive side by 2
or
e.g. $-1+-1=-2$
![[Pasted image 20220403092227.png]]
We can see it shifted towards to negative side by 1
### Negative Subtraction
Subtraction is essentially pushing away.
e.g. $-1-1=1$
![[Pasted image 20220403092227.png]]
Note that this has the same result as $-1+-1=-2$
So, adding a negative number and substracting a positive number does the same thing.
or
e.g. $-1--2=1$
![[Pasted image 20220403092124.png]]
So, subtracting a negative number and adding a positive number does the same thing.
**This is how, 2 positives is a positive, 2 negatives is a positive, and 1 of each is a negative.**
### Negative Multiplication
Multiplication increases the distance between the middle (0) and the point by a certain scale.
e.g. $1\times4=4$
![[Pasted image 20220403093201.png]]
It became 4 times further away.
The same applies with negative numbers.
e.g. $-1\times4=-4$
![[Pasted image 20220403093425.png]]
It became 4 times further away.
But how about things like $3\times-2$?

You would rearrange it.
$3\times-2=-2\times3$
Now it should be easy.
![[Pasted image 20220403093614.png]]
It became 3 times further away, becoming $-6$.
**A positive number times a positive number is a positive number. 
A negative number times a positive number is a negative number.**
How about a negative number times a negative number?
What is $-1\times-1$?

It is $1$.
So, **A negative number times a negative number is a positive number**
### Negative Divison
Follows all the rules of multiplication, but instead, it gets closer.
## Excerises
1. $-3+2$
2. $4+-1$
3. $3--9$
4. $14-25$
5. $6+3-5$
6. $7+-3--2$
7. $-1\times-5$
8. $3\times-2$
9. $9\times7$
10. $9\div-3$
11. $-45\div15$
## Problems
1. Claudia had $4$ cookies, but Mum said she would take away $-7$. How many cookies does Claudia have?

2. Christian got $83$ marks in his science test, but the teacher gave him an extra $-4$ marks. What is Christian mark now?

3. Magic Man told Claudia that he will multiply her amount of cookies (from question 1) by $-5$. How many cookies does she have now?

4. I started with a number. I multiplied it by $-6$, subtracted $-5$, and divided it by $-1$. It ended with 67. What did I start with?
