# Structure of DNA
DNA are made up of intertwined double helix of a sugar-phosphate backbone, connected to each other by the weak hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases.
## Nucleotides
```ad-Definition

A nucleotide is the building blocks of DNA, consisting of a deoxyribose (pentose) sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.

```
In nucleotides, there is one phosphate group attached to the deoxyribose sugar's 5' side and another on its 3' side.
### Nitrogenous bases
Type | 2 bonds | 3 bonds
