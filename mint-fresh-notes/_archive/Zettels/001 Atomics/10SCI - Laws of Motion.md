# 10SCI - Laws of Motion
Forces on any object can be shown using **force diagrams** or **free body diagram**. These diagrams use labelled arrows to show all the forces. The direction shows the direction of the force and the length represents size of the force.

Some examples of forces would be:
- Gravity
- Bouyancy
- Drag
- Thrust
- Air Resistance
- Friction
- Normal/Uplift

In physics, **weight** is a force, whilst **mass** is the quantity of matter. Weight is calculated by: $$$\text{Weight (in Newtons)} = \text{Mass (in kg)} \times g$$
There are always more than one forces acting upon an object. When these forces are all added together whilst accounting for direction, we get a resultant force, also known as a net force. When the net force does not equal zero, it is unbalanced.
## Friction
Friction is a contact force between two objects that works in opposition to motion. When friction is caused by air, it is named **air resistance**, and when caused by water, it is named **drag**. **Lubricants** are substances that are reduce the amount of friction between two objects, often made with oils (fossil fuels).
