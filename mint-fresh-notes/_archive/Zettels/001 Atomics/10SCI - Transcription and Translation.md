# 10SCI - Transcription and Translation
**Same as [[10SCI - Protein Synthesis]]**
 1. The transcription of DNA occurs in the nucleus, where RNA polymerase, upon binding to a promoter region, unwinds a single gene of DNA by breaking the weak hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases.
2. RNA polymerase moves in a 5' - 3' direction attaching free-floating nucleotides to their corresponding complementry base pairs on the template (antisense) strand.
	1. Adenine to Uracil
	2. Guanine to Cytosine
	3. Cytosine to Guanine
	4. Thymine to Adenine
3. This creates a single stranded RNA, known as pre-mRNA.
4. pre-mRNA undergoes RNA splicing, where a spliceosome complex splices introns, ~~non-coding segments of DNA~~, from the pre-mRNA strand, and the remaining exons, ~~coding segments of DNA~~, are reattached, creating mature mRNA.
5. This mature mRNA then leaves the nucleus through a nuclear pore, and binds to a ribosome, ~~a macromolecular machine, in the cytoplasm~~.
6. Translation begins when the ribosome reads a start codon whilst moving in a 5' to 3' direction.
7. tRNA, a molecule that carries particular amino acids, will attach its anti-codons to the mRNA's codons, ~~a sequence of 3 consecutive nucleotides~~. The sequence of mRNA codons will determine the order of amino acids.
8. The ribosome catalyses the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids.
9. This process continues until the ribosome reads a stop codon, where then the polypeptide detaches.
