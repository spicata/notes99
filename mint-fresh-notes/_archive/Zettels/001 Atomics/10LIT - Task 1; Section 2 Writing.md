# 10LIT - Task 1; Section 2 Writing
Black drops of rain fell from dark, foreboding clouds as they rolled in, plunging the town into a great darkness; plants mourning the sun. Chimneys ==exhaling== smoke, mixing and blending into the ~~clouds~~ as the drifted up, allowing the occasional dying ember to float out, only to be smited by volley of heavy, large droplets. 

It was dark, the nearby river, which many had depended on, due to years of ash and smoke, rendering it impossible to drink; parched workers having to resort to cheaper alcohol over water as injuries becoming more common. It was dark, the forest, as soot from the factories covered the trees, suffocating them. It was dark, the ground, years of little sunlight starving all once verdant grass.

Horses and dogs becoming amorphous beasts as they melded into the shadows. Along with the foot passengers, they became a congealed mass, moving rhythmatically, completely apathetic towards the ==unfavourable== weather. The river of unidentifiable masses flowed around corners, through intersections, into buildings, all going somewhere. There was conversation, barking, neighing, but it was all eclipsed by the sychronous clanging of iron picks on the hard, cold, rock ground, reverberating throughout the town.

A wave of down-troddened, demoralised miners flowed out of the coal mines as their shifts ended, covered in mud and sweat and soot, and carrying the scent of brimstone along with them, dispersing into the crowd. Walking along with them was Stanley Conrad.

Stanley was not very different from anyone else in the town, his uniqueness lay with the fact that there was nothing unique about him. He was a fine worker, possibly the best there was - unquestioning, diligent, desperate; unable to secure a more thriving career. Walking along the dark streets, his broken leather soles tapping softly; he peered into the glass windows of shops on either side, knowing that he would be unable to purchase any of the vanities that he found within. Clutching his pay for today in his hand, he would scurry home, as he had every other day, hoping that no trouble would befall him.

Conrad had lived in this town, which would have no name, for his entire life, unable to escape the shackles of his family's debt. Despite his downcomings, he had been able to have a family, of which he worked desperatly, day and night, to keep together. He was an optimistic man, and went to his work everyday, believing that that day might be the day where he would strike gold, and that everything would work out for him. He would have drank away his problems along with his fellow miners, but he lacked the money to do so, as, despite being the most diligent miners in the town, he was never paid equally with his friends, forever keeping him and his family in debt.

Despite his efforts, trouble followed him everywhere. Last year, it was the storm. Last week, it was the disease. Tonight, he had the misfortune of meeting his boss, Sir William. Stanley had been slaving away in the mines when he was interrupted by a rather rotund man, who asked him who Stanley was. Stanley knew this man, his face plastered outside of the hellish hole that he mined. Sir William, manager of the town's mines.

Sir William was not as dull as he looked, his noticed everything, the nervous fidgeting with the pick, the broken shoes and his ripped pants, but what caught his attention most was the glint of desperation in Stanley's eyes. When it came time to pay his worker's, he had removed 3 pence from Stanley's name; he recieved no retaliation.
