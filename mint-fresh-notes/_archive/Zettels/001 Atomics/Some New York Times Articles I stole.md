# One Part of Your Life You Shouldn’t Optimize
In a recent conversation with a colleague, the topic of Zoom came up, and I pointed out that the advantage of socializing with friends on video is the ability to simply say goodbye and X out of the conversation — no need for lingering or superfluous pleasantries. My colleague laughed and remarked: “Even better: Stay on a free Zoom trial! This way, it kicks you off after 40 minutes, regardless of what is happening.” [^1]

[^1]: Personal Story and Humour

And she’s right: Pandemic-era socializing can be incredibly efficient. But maybe — hear me out — efficiency shouldn’t be the main goal when it comes to friendship? Intimate relationships take time to build and their benefits are not measurable, at least not in immediate and quantifiable ways. [^2]

[^2]: Paragraph 2 introduces the stance

Even before Covid, a stark and disconcerting trend was underway: a decline in meaningful relationships and a [rise in social isolation](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/health/lonliness-aging-health-effects.html)[^3]. A [2019 survey](https://www.cigna.com/static/www-cigna-com/docs/about-us/newsroom/studies-and-reports/combatting-loneliness/cigna-2020-loneliness-factsheet.pdf) found that a whopping 61 percent of Americans reported [feeling lonely](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/opinion/loneliness-political-polarization.html)[^3]. Making [friends as an adult is difficult](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/01/how-to-make-new-friends-midlife/621231/)[^3], and [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886920302324?casa_token=jFruqWmzvvwAAAAA:3Qtg1rzLNZtz2xVvWjQHFMNmM-trCiJiosUKN_OsnQoxu4-lyAIPpF8PvPLFSdxzpXMYSU0i-g)[^3] published in 2020 in the journal Personality and Individual Differences offers some clues as to why: Among the top reasons adults have an especially hard time making friends is that they are less likely to trust new people — and because they say they don’t have time. [^4]

[^4]: The main point of the information

Though there are many factors underlying what Surgeon General Vivek Murthy[^5] has called the “[loneliness epidemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/10/04/this-former-surgeon-general-says-theres-a-loneliness-epidemic-and-work-is-partly-to-blame/),” I lay the blame for some of it on our collective obsession with optimization and efficiency. This obsession has gotten worse since the pandemic began — with a [recent study by Microsoft suggesting](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/04/triple-peak-day-work-from-home/629457/) that knowledge workers are doing much more work in the evenings and on average logging an hour more work per day overall. [^6]

[^5]: Quoting a professional
[^6]: Information on why

It’s not just that extra work leaves us less time for socializing. In the age of Covid and social distancing, we have become, by necessity, risk-averse. As the boundaries between work and life have blurred, we’ve said no to social invitations to protect our time, as well as our mental and physical health; we’ve cut people out of our lives who hurt us or bring us down; and we’ve prioritized family and our closest friends over casual acquaintances. [^7]

[^7]: Refers to topical information

No doubt, there are some real benefits to this shrinkage of our social circles, and perhaps even in the culling of certain relationships. Saying yes to everyone and everything, and overextending ourselves in the process may be a good habit to shed. Many of us during the pandemic have embraced solitary joys such as reading or gardening, and that is all well and good.

But sometimes I wonder: Are we saying no to that coffee or birthday party invitation because we genuinely don’t want to do it, or because we are addicted to optimization and efficiency? [^8]

[^8]: Rhetorical questions and inclusive language

I have [spoken](https://www.gq.com/story/brad-stulberg-interview) and [written](https://thegrowtheq.com/how-to-stay-grounded-in-a-frantic-and-frenetic-world/) about “heroic individualism,” the term I use to describe the game of one-upmanship that many of us engage in, against both ourselves and others. In that mind-set, measurable achievement is the main arbiter of success, and productivity is prioritized over people. To research my book on groundedness, I interviewed hundreds of people from different walks of life on what they value, how they spend their time, and their levels of fulfillment — and it seemed to me that heroic individualism was on the rise before Covid. Then it got a booster. [^9]

[^9]: Shows that they are an expert in this topic.

Earlier in the pandemic, people with the privilege to do so [streamlined their entire lives](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/opinion/pandemic-home-going-out.html). We got our groceries delivered. We exercised in our basements. We ate lunch at our kitchen tables, which had become our desks, and scheduled our virtual interactions in half-hour increments. 

==To be clear, much of this was for good reason. We had to protect ourselves and others from the virus and, for those of us with kids, we had to protect our sanity during whack-a-mole school closures.==

==But now that offices are calling workers back and socializing is returning to something resembling normal for many of us, we have to decide which pandemic-era habits to hold on to, and which to ditch. It might be tempting to retain some of these social efficiencies — especially if you’ve found you’re crushing your to-do lists and enjoying the Netflix catalog. But there is an inertia to an optimized way of life in which time for building and rebuilding friendships can all too easily get cannibalized.==

==It was hard enough to make and maintain friendships as an adult beforehand. In our new, streamlined way of life, it’s even harder. While the [research](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=facpub) is unequivocal that relationships are key to both mental and physical health, meaningful relationships are neither productive nor efficient, at least not in the short term.==

==Making new friends involves many inefficiencies: hanging out for hours on end; buying or preparing food or drinks for people who you may or may not click with; traveling to unfamiliar places or homes at appointed times, even when you’re not in the mood; commuting to the gym or the neighborhood park instead of working out at home. Not to mention, maintaining existing friendships also takes work and emotional investment — without any guarantee of a return.==

==If your goal is optimization today, tomorrow or this week, it almost always makes sense to push friendship-building and maintenance down the list of priorities. But I’d suggest that the more important cost-benefit analysis to do is the longer-term one: If your goal is to be grounded and fulfilled over the course of a lifetime, then there is nothing more important than nurturing our essential bonds.==

Building a community of friends, even if it starts with a feeling of obligation, boredom or mild irritation at the time invested in it, is a part of how we protect ourselves and our families from the vagaries of human existence, as the writer Jonathan Tjarks [wrote movingly in The Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/2022/3/3/22956353/fatherhood-cancer-jonathan-tjarks) recently. Facing his own cancer diagnosis and thinking about who would be there for his young son if he dies, he describes the investment of time he has made into making friends in a “life group” he attends regularly at his church: “Life group is a different kind of insurance,” he writes. “People talk a lot about medical insurance and life insurance when you get sick. But relational insurance is far more important.” [^10]

[^10]: Anecdotes from others

The good news is that even if our relationship-building muscles have atrophied, with a bit of work they’ll regain their strength. The [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07755-000) of John Cacioppo, a social neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, found that while loneliness and isolation build on themselves, so too do friendships and community. As you meet and connect with a greater number of people, you expand your social skills and confidence. [^11]

Like so much else about emerging from this pandemic, the key is [pushing through the resistance](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/13/opinion/culture/pandemic-languishing-behavioral-activation.html) and making a first step — in whatever way you deem it safe to do so, given your health situation and Covid surges. That might mean asking a neighbor to go for a walk, agreeing to an after-work drink even if you’re a bit tired, or making a dinner date with a friend whom you haven’t spoken with in a while. My wife, Caitlin, often tells me, “You’ll be glad when you’re there, and you’ll be glad afterward that you did it.” She’s always right. [^12]

[^12]: More quoting of people

Is there pleasure — and a certain nobility — in solitude? Of course, especially for introverts like myself. But even the Buddha himself directed his followers to seek companionship. In the Pali Canon, one of the oldest remaining Buddhist texts, the Buddha’s loyal attendant, Ananda, [approaches his master](https://www.lionsroar.com/spiritual-friendship-is-the-path/) and asks whether it’s true that “good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship” make up half of the spiritual life.

“Not so, Ananda! Not so!” the Buddha replies sternly. “This is the _entire_ spiritual life, Ananda — that is, good friendship, good companionship and good comradeship.” [^13]

# A Biden Blood Bath?
A recent poll truly shocked me. [^14]

[^14]: Short sentences, strong start, strong emotions, personal

Quinnipiac University found that President Biden’s approval rating had sunk to just 33 percent. You might argue that this was just one poll, but Biden’s approval is down in multiple surveys. [^3]

As CNN’s Harry Enten pointed out Friday, there were four major national polls released last week, and in three of them — including Quinnipiac — Biden had his lowest showing of his presidency. In the fourth, he was “one point off the lowest.”

These are just devastating results on the heels of a historic Supreme Court confirmation and only seven months out from the midterms.

When Politico’s Ryan Lizza last week asked Biden pollster John Anzalone how dire the situation had become for Democrats, Anzalone responded in blunt terms, saying that no Democratic consultant would say “that this is anything but a really sour environment for Democrats.”

Anzalone, like many Democrats, seems to believe that a major part of the problem is messaging, saying in the interview, “We’re scared of our own shadow on taxes and it … makes no sense.”

But what if the issue is not the messaging but the messenger? 

Poor messaging may contribute to the problem, but I think the problem is more on ground level, a gut level: How do people feel? They feel stuck and angry, they’re tired and overwhelmed, and that energy is being directed at Biden. [^15]

[^15]: Opinion in paragraph 8

Biden is a decent man. As a matter of course and tactic, he strikes me as not entirely built for hyperbole and hype, for beating his chest while he boasts. It’s not part of his character. He is sober and straightforward. Many Americans wanted him as an antidote to Donald Trump for precisely this reason.

But America has changed its mind and its mood. It wants a show and a showman to distract from its misery. Biden is not that. And he is being punished for not being a huckster.

There is an old saying that is some variation of, “People will forget what you said, but they won’t forget how you made them feel.” Biden isn’t constantly tweeting and hamming it up for the cameras — in fact, too often, he has shied away from interviews — and his reticence has left a void of emotional connection to him.
Editors’ Picks

I hate that emotional connection plays such an outsize role in our politics, but I also can’t deny that it does. If Americans can’t cheer you, they’ll chide you.

Biden’s presidency is far from a failure, but it has been stymied on some big promises that Biden made during the campaign on issues like voting rights and police reform. Lately it feels like, on domestic policy, Biden has moved from the macro to the micro, taking steps that will indeed benefit many Americans, but are too narrowly focused to transform our society or fix the core problems that plague it — trying to recruit more American truckers, focusing on Black maternal health, announcing an emergency waiver to allow higher ethanol blend gasoline to be sold this summer.

All the while, two major perennial issues are resurgent: crime and the economy. The fear of crime and the pinch of inflation aren’t abstractions, or complicated foreign policy, or perks for special interests. They creep into every door and lurk under every kitchen table.

And on the other side, Republicans are playing heavily into culture war issues like challenging the teaching of Black history and the history of white supremacy in schools, as well as restricting discussions of L.G.B.T. issues and campaigning against trans women and girls competing in sports with other women and girls. And they are using parental rights as the Trojan horse to enact their agenda.

Democrats, for their part, have almost ceded the parental rights argument, instead of fighting back and framing these efforts as oppressive and backward. They do not recognize that oppression by conservatives in this country is like an amoeba: simple, primitive, pervasive and highly adaptable. It simply shifts its shape to fit the environment and argument.

Republicans are using white parental fear, particularly the fears of white moms, worried about harm coming to their children, to attract suburban white women and get them to the polls. The oppression is a bonus.

There was another worrisome sign in the Quinnipiac poll: Biden’s approval rating among people identified as Hispanics was even lower than it was among those identified as white. Pundits have been discussing Biden’s declining numbers among Hispanics for months. In October, FiveThirtyEight pointed out that “there has been a drop in support for Biden among all three racial and ethnic groups we measured, but the drop among Hispanics — from the high 60s to slightly below 50 percent — marks Biden’s most precipitous decline.”

The reasons for this drop appear to range from a response to the pandemic to the fact that Hispanics hew conservative on some social issues.

But all this taken together — in addition to voter suppression and racial, political gerrymandering — may prove hugely problematic for Democrats and for the administration, unless they can turn things around before Election Day. If not, we could well be looking forward to a Biden blood bath.
