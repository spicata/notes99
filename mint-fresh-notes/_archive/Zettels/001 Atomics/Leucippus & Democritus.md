# Leucippus & Democritus
Somewhere in the 400 BCE (-399), Leucippus and Democritus theorised the existence of an indivisible particle.
These particles were named "atomos", meaning indivisible.
They suggested that, if a object were to be divided in half enough times, at a certain point, they would stop being able to be cut.
This is the start of the story of an atom.
