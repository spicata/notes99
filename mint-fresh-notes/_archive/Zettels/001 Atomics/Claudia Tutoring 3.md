## Chapter 1: Too Many Monomials
1. Find the product of... 
	1. $14x^3y^2z^7$, $2a^3x^4z^2$, $\frac15a^3b^9y^3$, $\sqrt1c^4z^3$, and $3a^3dy^4z^7$

How do you do this?
Rewrite it into an expression:
$14x^3y^2z^7\times2a^3x^4z^2\times\frac15a^3b^9y^3\times\sqrt1c^4z^3\times3a^3dy^4z^7$

Groups all the **like** terms together.
$14\times2\times\frac15\times\sqrt1\times3=\frac{84}{5}=16.8$
$x^{3}\times x^{4}=x^{7}$
$y^{2}\times y^{3}\times y^{4}=y^{9}$
$z^{7}\times z^{2}\times z^{3}\times z^{7}=z^{19}$
$a^{3}\times a^{3}\times a^{3}=a^{9}$
$b^{9}=b^{9}$
$c^{4}=c^{4}$
$d=d$

All together:
$16.8a^{9}b^{9}c^{4}dx^{7}y^{9}z^{19}$

So, uuh, practice I guess:
1. Find the product of...
	1. $12x^{3}y^{4}z^{5}$, $10x^{2}y^{7}z$, and $4xy^3z^4$
	2. $40p^3e^4a^2n^3$,$\frac14u^3ts^6$, $n^{4}t^{2}s^{5}$, and $3p^{4}a^{5}$
## Chapter 2: Circumferences and Diameters
1. The circumference of a drawing of my perfectly round head and the diameter has a difference of $10$ centimetres. What is the area of my face?

From this problem:
$C=d+10$

We also know:
$C=2\pi r=d\pi$

So:
$d+10=d\pi$
$10=d\pi - d$
$10=(\pi-1)d$
$\frac{10}{\pi-1}=d$
$4.7=d$
$2.35=r$

To find the area:
$A=\pi r^{2}$
$A=2.35^{2}\pi$
$A=17.35\text{cm}^2$

1. The circumference of a ball and the radius of it has a difference of $12$ centimetres. 
	1. What is the radius?
	2. What is the area?
2. A circle (very creative) has a difference of $50$ metres between its circumference and its diameter.
	1. What is the radius?
	2. What is the area?
