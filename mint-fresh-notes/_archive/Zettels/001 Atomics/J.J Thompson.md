# J.J Thompson
In 1890s, discharge tubes, more specifically, cathode rays. J.J Thompson discovered that these discharge tubes could work backwards.
Through this, he discovered the negatively charged particles, which he named "corpuscles," now known as an "electron."
Through finding the amount of heat generated from the ray, he was able to predict the weight of an electron, which he found to be 1000x smaller than a hydrogen atom.
