# 10SCI - Kinematics
## Scalars and Vectors
- **Scalars** only have a *magnitude*
- **Magnitude** is "size"
- $22\text{ms}^{-1}$ has a *magnitude* of $22$
	1. Distance
	2. Mass
	3. Temperature
	4. Time
- **Vectors** have both *magnitude* and *direction*
	1. Velocity
	2. Displacement
	3. Acceleration
	4. Force
	5. Momentum
- **Vectors** are represented as an *arrow*.
- **Length** of the arrow is *magnitude*
- **Direction** of the arrow is... *direction*
## Measurements
- **Speed** uses the *distance tringle*, it is *scalar*
- **Velocity** is *vector* speed essentially. 
	- $v_{av}=\frac{s}{t}$ where $v_{av}$ is *average velocity*, $s$ is *displacement*, $t$ is *time*
- **Displacement** 
- **Distance** is the *actual length* of the *path a body takes*, *regardless of direction*, it is *scalar*
- **Speed** is the *distance travelled per unit of time*, it is *scalar*
- **Velocity** is the *displacement* of a body *per unit of time*, it is *vector*
- **Acceleration** is the *rate of change* of *velocity*, *vector*
	- Positive acceleration is going faster
	- Negative acceleration is going slower, or deceleration
	- $a=\frac{v-u}{t}$ where $a$ is *acceleration*, $v$ is *final velocity*, $u$ is *initial velocity*, and $t$ is *time*
	- Measured in $\text{ms}^{-2}$ 
```ad-caution

SCALAR ALWAYS HAVE DIRECTION (and units but hopefully you know that by now)

```
- **Gravity** is *acceleration down*
	- $-9.8\text{ms}^{-2}$
