# 10SCI - Evolution
```ad-Definition

Evolution is a cumulative, hereditary change in a population over a long period of time (many generations)

```
## Types
### Divergent
Divergence is a pattern of evolution in which difference between groups of organims accumulate to a critical point that leads to speciation, the development of a new species.
Usually happens to a single species of two populations in to different environment.
These populations can be subjected to different environmental pressures, suited to certain structures that can perform functions specific to surviving their unique environment.
An indicator of a relatively recent common ancestor.
Homologous structures (a primary structure) are an indicator of divergent evolution.
```ad-example

The pentadactyl limb is a structure found in many land dwelling, as well some whales, that has 5 fingers.

```
### Convergent
Convergent evolution is a parttern that occures when unrelated organisms evolve similar adaptations in response to their environment.
An indicator of a relatively distant common ancestor.
Analogous structures (secondary structures) are an indicator of convergent evolution.
```ad-example

The snout is a example of convergent evolution

# Terminology
```ad-Definition
title: Theory of Evolution

Theory of evolutions states that all organisms have developed from previous organisms and that all living things have a common ancestor in some initial of primitive life.

```
```ad-Definition
title: Mechanisms

Mechanisms cause the basis of evolution; changes in allele frequencies within a gene pool.

```
```ad-Definition
title: Population

A population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same geographic area and readily interbreed to produce fertile offspring.

```
```ad-Definition
title: Variation

Variation, is based on differences in DNA sequence, which gives rise to different forms of alleles.

```
```ad-Definition
title: Gene Pool

A gene pool is a collection of all the genes and alleles in a certain population

```
```ad-Definition
title: Mutation

A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence of a gene. A mutation can change one allele to another, but the net effect is a change in the frequency of a existing allele.
