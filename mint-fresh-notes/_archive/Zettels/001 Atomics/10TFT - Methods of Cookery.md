# 10TFT - Methods of Cookery
## Chapter 1: Conduction, Convection, Radiation
- **Conduction** is the transfer of heat through solid materials.
- When two differently-temperatured objects are touching, heat will flow between them,
- The vibration of the molecules are transferred to touching molecules.
- Closer parts are cooked faster than further parts.
- *Deep-frying a battered fish*
- **Convection** is the transfer of heat through gas or liquids.
- *Baking bread*
- **Radiation** is the transfer of heat through rays.
- Cooks almost evenly through the food
- *Toasting bread*
- Some foods can undergo more than one method.
- *Bread is baked (convection cooking), then they are toasted (radiation cooking).*
Style of Cooking | Heat Transfer | Elaboration | Method
--- | --- | --- | ---
Grilling/Barbecuing | Radiation | Rays reach fod directly | Dry
Baking | Convection | Hot air movements/currents | Dry
Roating | Convection | Hot air movements/currents | Dry
Frying - Deep | Conduction | Transfer of heat through oil | Dry
Boiling | Conduction, Convection | Transfer of heat through saucepan, followed by hot liquid currents | Wet
Poaching | Conduction, Convection | Transfer of heat through saucepan, followed by hot liquid currents | Wet
Stewing | Conduction, Convection | Transfer of heat through saucepan, followed by hot liquid currents | Wet
Steaming | Conduction, Convection | Transfer of heat through saucepan, followed by hot liquid currents | Wet
Braising | Conduction, Convection | Transfer of heat initially through frypan, then through added liquids | Wet
Microwaving | Radiation | Electromagnetic waves cause water molecules to vibrate resulting in the formation of hear energy | Microwave

## Chapter 2: Dry, Wet, and... Microwave?
- **Dry cooking** is a cooking method that doesn't have water.
- *Grilling, barbecuing, baking, roasting, frying, deep-frying*
## Chapter 3: Appealing to the Senses
- Roasting/Frying/Deep Frying - Crunchy
