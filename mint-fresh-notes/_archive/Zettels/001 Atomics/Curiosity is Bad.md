# Curiosity is Bad
In 2015, a 55-year-old woman nicknamed "Cat Mom" was setting up a shelter for stray cats, before she was struck by a brick falling from the sky, causing fatal injuries.

The culprit? 

A fourth grader who had just learnt about physics and curious about if objects of different masses really did fall at the same speed, causing him to throw several objects including a **brick** off several apartment buildings.

Curiosity killed the cat; in this case, it killed the "Cat Mom".

This may have just been caused by insufficient caution and supervision, but I think this story highlights a problem with curiosity, the need to fill a gap in knowledge, even if this information is useless or harmful and the method of aquiring the information is dangerous.

The human tendency to seek information has been explored by Bowen Ruan and Christopher Hsee in their experiments (The Pandora Effect: The Power and Peril of Curiosity). They found that people were more likely to choose uncertain results than results that were clearly good or clearly bad.

As Bowen Ruan puts it, "curiosity can lure humans - like you and me - to seek information with predictably ominous consequences". In the information age, this attraction to seeking new information is a double-edged sword. If used properly, it allows us to learn more meaningful information. 

However, more often than not, this is not very helpful. People end up falling into rabbit hole of useless knowledge where they can spend an endless amount of valuable time searching for unnecessary things.

Of course, there are real benefits to being curious, we would not be where we are now without curiosity. Our modern technologies would not have existed without curious thinkers who happened to stumble across amazing discoveries. Humanity may not have survived if our curiosity hadn't got us to expand our horizons.

However, constantly absorbing irrelevant and isolated pieces of information is not the curiosity that pushed us into this era.

The pursuit of new experiences and information can also cause us to do some pretty dumb stuff, with predictibly bad results. Exploring dangerous terrain (Because It Is There: The Challenge of Mountaineering… for Utility Theory), clicking potentially electric pens (The Pandora Effect: The Power and Peril of Curiosity), and... well... throwing a brick off a building.

All of these are cases of experimentation in an attempt to learn "something", and any person can see that these are not great decisions to make. But people still make irrational decisions.

Rubbernecking is the act of turning your head around to see an accident or anything else that may catch your attention while driving. If you drive, you know you've done it too. Think back, why did you do it?

Was it possibly because you were curious about what had happened? In those few seconds when you were distracted, you may have caused another accident. In fact, 10 to 16 percent of all accidents are caused by rubbernecking.

These are all risks tied with curiosity. Contiueing to be curious is good, but don't let it lead you astray, down unnecessary roads.

"We keep moving forward, opening new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths." - Walt Disney.

But it is our job to see if those paths are really worth taking.
