# Curiosity
## Negatives
### The Pandora Effect
- When a lack of information exists, our brain works to fill it.
- It causes us to **open the box** much like Pandora, even under ominous circumstances.
- *Revealing partially blocked images (of insects), seeing which pens shock you, exploring dangerous terrain, playing things harmful to our senses, seeking harmful scenes.*
- We can predict the outcome of these, but humans still decide to do these, because humans are... humans.
#### Pen Experiment
- Univeristy students, when waiting for another experiment, were given an array of electric pens to kill time.
- Some students get pens that are labelled (green or red), if they are shockers or not.
- Some student get uncertain pens (yellow)
- Results: More people clicked the yellow pen that the green and red pens.
#### Pen Experiment 2
- More University students were given pens, specifically 10 red pens, 10 yellow pens, 10 green pens.
- Red always shocks, green never does, yellow is either way
- There are doubles the amount of certain choices, however, the yellow pen was clicked more than the certain choices combined
### Curious or Distracted
- Curiosity and distractedness is pretty similar.
- What one says is curiosity could just be them being distracted.
- Are you really curious on all the functionalilties of Word, or are you just putting off that English task that you have to complete.
- Do you really need to test your clicks per second
- I know I am.
