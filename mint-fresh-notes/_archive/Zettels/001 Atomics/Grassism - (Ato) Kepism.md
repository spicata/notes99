# Grassism - (Ato) Kepism
## Principles:
1. Lay a Foundation
2. A Strong Society
3. Help brings help
4. Weeding out weeds
5. Adaptability
6. An Unstoppable Optimism
### Lay a Foundation
When doing anything, a foundation should always be created. It's irresponsible to create anything without organising or creating plans. This is how Kepists organise and work.
### A Strong Society

## Method:
### Lay a Foundation
When we organise, there are some things we have to consider:
- What is the goal?
- Who is responsible?
- Who will it effect?
- Is it possible/reasonable?
- Can you do it with the resources?
- Why?
#### What is the goal?
