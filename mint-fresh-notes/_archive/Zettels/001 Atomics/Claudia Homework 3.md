## Simultaneous Equations
1. I buy $3$ pencils and $1$ mechanical-pencil and spend \$$10$ dollars. I can buy $4$ pencils and $7$ mechanical-pencils and spend \$$36$. What is the cost of each?
2. I sell $3$ mint leaves and $4$ bombs and get \$$501$ dollars. I can sell $230$ mint leaves and $3$ bombs and get \$$1730$. What is the cost of each?
3. Magic Man buys $20$ new hats and $11$ wands and uses \$$1264$ dollars. He can also buy $12$ hats and $34$ wands and use \$$868$. What is the cost of each?
4. In a farm, there are chickens and cows. I see $169$ heads, and $542$ legs. How many animals are there of each?
5. I can also see a field of pigs and some invasive ducks. I see $110$ heads, and $416$ legs. How many animals are there of each?
6. I buy $2$ red beans and sell $3$ blue beans to the Magic Man and spend \$$13$. Instead, if I buy $4$ red beans and buy $7$ blue beans to the Magic Man, I spend \$$39$. How much does each bean cost? (I want you to eliminate the blue beans, not the red.)
