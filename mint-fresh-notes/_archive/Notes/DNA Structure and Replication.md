# DNA Structure and Replication

When cells replicate, its DNA replicates into two identical, double-helix DNA molecules, each consisting of one old and one new strand. This is called ==semi-conservative replication==, as one of its original strands are conserved from one generation to the next. DNA replication occurs in the S phase of interphase during the cell cycle (See the [[Phases of the Cell Cycle]]).
DNA replication begins when the enzyme ==DNA helicase== starts breaking the weak hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides in the DNA; thus revealing the nitrogenous bases. This happens gradually. Due to this, there are situations where there is still a junction between the unwound single strand of DNA and the intact double helix, called the ==replication fork==.

The stockpiles of free nucleotides attach to the now exposed nitrogenous bases with the help of ==DNA polymerase==. Then another enzyme, ==DNA ligase==, catalyses the formation of ==phosphodiester bonds==. 
As DNA strands are anti-parallel, DNA polymerase also works in opposite directions. On the ==leading strand==, the polymerase works towards the replication fork, and thus synthesises continuously. On the ==lagging strand==, the polymerase works away from the fork, and synthesises in pieces called ==Okazaki fragments==.
