# English - Describe Day Thing

3:40. The interior of the house filled with the brimming sunlight of the unstopped sun. After 7 hours of absence, I return, to a living room buzzing with energy; taking a break before setting up my computer.
4:00. I begin to do my work, assignments received during the day, and the homework given by the teachers. The conversations blocked out by the sound of the iconic waves of Ireland in my ears. Isolated in my own world. Time flies.
4:25, the first break. Getting up, I refill my glass to drink. 5 short minutes, before I resume. The house is considerably more quiet, as everyone is doing their tasks. The distinctly low hum of the generator softly vibrates through the house.
4:30, I continue. 3 repetitions yet to go. My parents listen out for the public service announcement.
Five-eleven, lights turned on, replacing the now ~~dwindling~~ obscured sunlight. The aroma of food begins to fill the air. Conversations I cannot hear begin to start again.
Six-three, I join my family, talking, as we begin to eat dinner.
Seven, eight o'clock, I begin research on an earth sciences task. I ponder if this will truly be useful anymore. Plate tectonics and the inner works of the Earth. Nothing we can observe.
Nine o'clock. Sun back in view, outshining all the other stars in the endless black.
Nine-thirty.
