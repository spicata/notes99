# 202202081646: Why would someone encrypt stuff?
#article/computerScience 
Ever since the start of **internet**, **[[202202081623|encryption]]**, and **cryptography** has been gaining more and more traction. This is due to a wide variety of reasons, but there are 5 key functions of **encryption**:
1. **Privacy and Obfuscation**: Using encryption so that your information is safe(r) from threats
2. **Authentication**: To prove that it is really you, and not an impersonation
3. **Integrity**: To make your information harder to manipulate
4. **Non-repudiation**: Essentially the same as **authentication**
5. **Key exchange**: To protect you **key** as you move it on the internet[^1]
