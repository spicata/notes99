## Notes
### SDLC
standard development life cycle
#### Phases
1. Preliminary analysis - define the problem
	1. feasability study
2. analysis - define the goals based on needs
	1. model current system using cd and dfd
		1. collect data -> quality is good data, quantity is many
			1. e.g. survey is quantity
			2. e.g. observing
			3. e.g. interview -> quality
			4. e.g. shadowing 
			5. e.g. focus groups
			6. e.g. questionare
	2. using computer aided software engineering tools (gantt and pert, cd and dfd)
	3. requirements of the new system from collected data
3. design = design physical and logical parts
	1. logical desgin = abstract design
	2. physical design = technology-specific details
4. development
5. implementation
	1. direct cut = entire system in at once
	2. pilot = new system goes in little bit at a time
	3. parallel = new system with old system
	4. phase = new system in, old system out
6. eval and maintenance
