**tldr:** Translation is the process of turning mRNA into a sequence of amino acids, which occurs in the ribosome with the help of tRNA.
**also see:** [[Biology - Genetic Code & Codons]]

## Notes
Translation = mRNA -> sequence x amino acids in polypeptide chain
Ribosome bind -> mRNA in cell's cytoplasm
Ribosome moves in 5' - 3' until start codon
Anticodon in tRNA attaches - mRNA
tRNA carry amino acid
Ribosome catalyse formation x peptide bonds <= condensation reaction
Ribosome moves along mRNA forming peptide bonds until stop codon -> release polypeptide chain

## Cue
So are the ends of the mRNA not start and stop codons?
