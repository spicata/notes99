## Notes
Goes in 5' - 3' direction
On 5' side, 5' cap = added
5' cap = modified guanosine triphosphate
5' cap stops enzymes <- hydrolyzing mRNA
5' cap tells ribosome where - start
On 3' side, poly(A) tail
Poly tail = 30 - 200 adenine

In mRNA, coding segment = small
Coding segment codes -> polypeptides
Leader = RNA segment before coding segment
Trailer = RNA segment after coding segmnet
Terminator = in trailer
Terminator = ! stop codon

<- 5' - 3' direction:
1. 5' cap
2. Leader
3. Start Codon
4. Exons
5. Stop Codon
6. Trailer
7. Poly(A) Tail
