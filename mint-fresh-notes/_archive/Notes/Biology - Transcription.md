**told:** RNA polymerase creates mRNA by copying one DNA strand with transcription.

## Notes
Transcription = Producing RNA sequence <- DNA template
RNA polymerase seperates DNA strands & makes RNA copy <- DNA strand
Done by covalently bonding ribonucleoside triphosphates <- complementry partner
Once transcription = finished, RNA polymerase will detach from DNA.
Happens in the nucleus

3 types of RNA:
- Messenger RNA (mRNA) = transcription of gene
- Transfer RNA (tRNA) = carrier of amino acid
- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) = component of ribosome

Goes in 5' - 3' direction

## Cues
How come both thymine and uracil bonds to adenine?
What happens if a thymine accidentlly bonds in RNA?
