# Phases of the Cell Cycle

To replicate, a cell needs to first duplicate its genetic material (DNA), and physically split into two daugther cells. In eukaryotic cells, the cycle is split into two major parts. The ==interphase== and the ==mitotic phase==.
- **During interphase**, the cell duplicates its DNA.
- **During the mitotic phase**, the cell seperates into two identical cells.

## Interphase
1. **G<sub>1</sub> phase**: During the G<sub>1</sub> phase, also known as the first gap phase, the cell grows larger physically, copies organelles, and prepares for the later steps.
2. **S phase**: In the S phase, the cell synthesises a complete copy of their DNA. It also duplicates the ==centrosome==, which helps seperate the DNA during the mitotic phase. (See the [[DNA Structure and Replication]])
3. **G<sub>2</sub> phase**: During the G<sub>2</sub> phase, or the second gap phase, the cell grows larger still, and makes more organelles, and reorganises to facilitate mitosis. The G<sub>2</sub> phase ends when mitosis begins.
