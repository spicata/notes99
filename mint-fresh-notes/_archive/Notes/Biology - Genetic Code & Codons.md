**tldr:** Genetic code is an universal and denegerative set of rules on making proteins made of codons.
**also see:** [[Biology - Translation]]

---
## Notes
Genetic code = rules encoded -> making proteins
Genetic code = made x codons
Codons = triplet x bases -> encodes amino acid
4 bases w/ 3 per codon => 64 codon combinations
Order x codon determines amino acid sequence
Starts w/ start codon
Stops w/ stop codon

Genetic code = universal = all living things uses same code[^1]
Genetic code = degenerate = 20 amino acids h/ 64 codons => codes same amino acid

## Cues
Why isn't there more than just 20 amino acids?
How does the start and stop codon start and stop?
