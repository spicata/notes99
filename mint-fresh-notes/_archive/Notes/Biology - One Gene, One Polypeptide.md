**tldr:** Each gene codes for one polypeptides, unless alternate splicing occurs.

## Notes
Gene = sequence x DNA -> encodes polypeptide sequence
Gene convert - polypeptide sequence -=- translation, & transcription
:. proteins = made up x :. polypeptides => need :. genes
e.g. haemoglobin = made up x 4 polpeptides
\>? gene = mutated => lead - synthesis x defective polypeptide
2 exceptions - "One Gene, One Polypeptide" rule:
- Genes econcoding -> tRNA, & mRNA do ! code -> polypeptide
- 1 gene can code -> >1 polypeptide if alternative splicing

## Cues
How is the first ribosome made? Would you not need another ribosome to make it?
How does tRNA bind to amino acids?
How does tRNA know when to come to ribosomes?
