# #Genetics - Terminology
---
>Gene
: stored set of instructions for a protein, fond on a specific locus (position) on a chromosome

>Allele
: A form of a gene; different alles code for the same traid but different versions of that trait. Pairs of alleles are found on a set of maternal and paternal homologous chromosome.

>Genotype
: The genetic composition of an organism for a particular trait, the set of alleles (one from each parent) that an organism has.

>Dominant allele
: Always expressed in the phenotype

>Recessive allele
: Only expressed in the phenotype when present with the same allele (homozygous) e.g. ww

>Homozygous
: Possesing two identical alleles of a gene

>Heterozygous
: Possessing two different alleles of a gene

>Pure Breed
: Identical set of alleles

>Punnett Square
: The diagram that shows all possible combinations of alleles and, therefore, all possible genotypes of offspring.
: **Include a key, the diagram, and a ratio table**

>Phenotype
: Observed trait

> Monohybrid Cross
> : Involves the fertilisation between two monohybrids

> Monohybrid
> : An organism that is heterozygous with respoect to a single gene.
