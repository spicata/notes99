# 202202081703: Why else might someone use encryption?
#article/computerScience 
There are many things that **[[202202081623|encryption]]** may be used for but are not mentioned, as this is not an exhuastive list. However, there are a few tidbits of information that I found interesting on why else someone might use **encryption**:
1. **Forward security**: In **forward security**, a new **key** is created for each **session**, so even if one **key** or the **server** is **compromised**, your data stays **encrypted**.
2. **Perfect Security**: A **perfect security system** is a type of **encryption** where no information about the **key** is relayed in the **ciphertext**. [^1]
