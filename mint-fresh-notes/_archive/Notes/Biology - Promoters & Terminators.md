**tldr:** Promoters signify where a gene start, terminators signifies where it ends.
**also see:** [[Biology - RNA Splicing]]

## Notes
Promoters = sequence x DNA - which RNA polymerase binds -
Promoters come directly next - gene in question
*This is how RNA polymerase knows where to stick to*
Terminator = basically promoter h/ end
Terminator come at end x gene || operon

## Cues
What is an operon?
How come promoters are not constantly binding to RNA polymerase?
