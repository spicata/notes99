A context diagram is a data flow diagram, with one massive central process that subusmes everything inside the scope of the system. It shows how the system will receive and send data flows to the external entities involved.

## Details
Shape | Represents

Arrow | Represents data flow 
The arrow represents data flow, not objects (e.g. Arrows represent the order **details** not the order.)
