1. Helicase breaks apart the strands, polymerase attaches the nucleotides, and ligase creates phosphodiester bonds
2. Helicase Seperates > Primer intiates > DNA polymerase attaches > Attaches nucleotides > DNA ligase attaches > Ligase removes primers > Forms phosphodiester bonds
3. Because it keeps one of the strands.
4. DNA has to replicate first for cell division to occur.
