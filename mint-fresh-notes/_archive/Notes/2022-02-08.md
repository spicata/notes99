Today was a good day. I discovered a new note taking system called the *Zettelkasten*. Complete waste of time. I transfered all my #article/computerScience to the *Zettelkasten* method, and now I need to change them all back. What a great use of 2 pomodoros. Luckily, I found a new way to take notes instead.
I could have done more, but I am fine with what I did.
