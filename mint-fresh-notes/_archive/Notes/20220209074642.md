# 20220209074642: How does *[[20220209074128|Protein Synthesis]]* happen?
#article/science 
In the nucleus, an enzyme known as *RNA polymerase* unzips a gene, and, starting at a *promotor*, attaches loose *nucleotides* to **one** (non-coding) strand of the *gene* (*[[Biology - Transcription|transcription]]*).[^1] This forms the *[[20220209094855|mRNA]]* in an *antiparallel* direction. The single-stranded *mRNA* then detaches and travels through a *nuclear pore* into *cytoplasm*.
In the *cytoplasm*, the *mRNA* locates and attaches to a *[[20220209091902|ribosome]]*. The *mRNA* initiates the process of *[[20220209075338|translation]]* by inserting the *start codon* (AUG) into the *ribosome*. *tRNA* then attaches its *anti-codon* side to the second *[[20220209094613|codon]]* of the *mRNA*. As more *tRNA* attaches to the *mRNA*, a *peptide bonds* forms between adjacent *[[20220209084738|amino acids]]*. This continues until a *stop codon* enters the *ribosome*, effectively shutting down the process of translation*, and detaches the *[[20220209074203|polypeptides]]*, before folding into a *[[20220209074128|protein]]*.

[^1]: This happens because the *DNA* is too large to fit through the *nuclear pores* in the *nucleus*.
