## Notes
Sub. cipher = method x encrypting ~ units x plaintext = replaced w/ ciphertext
Contrasting w/ transposition ciphers
Simple sub. ciphers operates on single letters
Polygraphic ciphers operates on larger groups
Monoalphabetic ciphers uses fixed sub.
Polyalphabetic ciphers uses mixed sub. across message
### Simple sub.
Sub. x single letters seperately
Determined using sub. alphabet
e.g.
![ENGIMA 3 FIG 1](http://accordingtobenedict.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ENGIMA-3-FIG-11-800x417.jpg)
Also known as sub. alphabet
Use different ways x alter alphabet
Shift alphabet -> Ceasar
Reverse alphabet -> Atbash
Scramble alphabet -> Mixed/Deranged alphabet
Can use different plaintext alphabet (! much help)
### Polygraphics
Simple sub. h/ w/ instead x 1 letter per sub. several letters per sub.
Polygraphic sub. 2 letters per time = bigraphic
