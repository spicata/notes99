## Notes
Thin, & narrow tip  x blade = best -> fine, & delicate work
e.g. garnishing detail, || cutting small items
Centre x knife = most common part -> general work
e.g. slicing vegetables
Heel x blade = best -> cutting thick, & dense meat
e.g. small bones, roots, || vegetables

### Precision Cutting
Julienne = long, & thin strips
3mm b 3mm b 40mm
Cut lengths x 40mm, & square off edgees => ! curves
Brunoise = fine dice
3mm b 3mm b 3mm
Same as Julienne h cut matchsticks => 3mm dices
Jardinière = batons
4mm b 4mm b 20mm
e.g. garnish
Macèdoine = dice
8mm b 8mm b 8mm
e.g. fruit salads and potatos
Paysanne = thin slices x food
15mm depth circles 
Chiffonade = slice leafy green vegetables -> long,  & thin strips
