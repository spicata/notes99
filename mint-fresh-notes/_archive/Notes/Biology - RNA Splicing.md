**tldr:** Transcribed mRNA is spliced of all the useless bits to produce "mature" mRNA.
**also see:** [[Biology - Transcription]]

## Notes
Genes = DNA segment coding -> a protein
Coding DNA = Exon
Non-coding DNA = Intron
During transcription, introns need - be removed through RNA splicing
DNA -> pre-mRNA -> mRNA -> Protein
pre-mRNA = snippet x . 1 gene (Transcripition).
mRNA = pre-mRNA w!/ introns (Splicing).
RNA splicing allows 1 gene - encode -> >1 protein by snipping out certain parts.

Spliceosomes = molecules ^ remove introns
Spliceosomes = made x 2 parts, snRNPs, & other proteins
snRNPs, || snurps = small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
Spliceosomes "splice" introns <- pre-mRNA
"Spliced" introns = excised introns

snRNPs = made x proteins, & snRNA

<- 5' - 3' direction:
1. 5' cap
2. Leader
3. Start Codon
4. Exons
5. Stop Codon
6. Trailer
7. Poly(A) Tail

## Cues
How do enzymes know what is introns and what is exons?
If 1 gene can code for >1 protein, how do enzymes know what exons to cut out?
How do enzymes know where one gene begins and another one ends? [[Biology - Promoters & Terminators]]
