# #Computer - Encryption
---
## Notes
Encrypting is a verb
Encrypting is securing data through a technique
Your data = Plaintext
Technique = cipher or mathmatics

### Cryptographic Algorithms
[[Computer - Cryptographic Algorithms]]

### Substitution Ciphers
Substitution cipher
method where units of plain replaced with ciphertext.
sub ciphers vs transposition cipher
units becomes different, position is the same.
if single letters, than simple
if many, than polgraphic
if fixed sub than monoalphabet
if dynamic sub then poly alphabet

any order alphabet = substiution alphabet
shifted, then cipher
revered, then atbash
if mixed, than mixed or deranged alphabet
no punctuation and also in blocks
e.g.
aaaaa aaaaa
padded with nulls e.g.
aaaaa aaa--
subs alphabet can be not alphabet
not really useful
hella weak
because of... FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION!
longer texts are easier

nomenclator stuff

homophonic subs
tries to make frequency more hard
more than one subs letter per letter
beale ciphers
Stahl tried to make homophonic for computers
book cipher

polyalphabetic cipher
each plain text is assigned more than one sub
