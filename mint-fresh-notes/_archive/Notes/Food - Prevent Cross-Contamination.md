# #Food - Prevent Cross-Contamination
**2022-02-14**

---
 ## Notes
 ### The book:
 Cross-cntam = bacteria or virus on contaminated surface -> uncontaminated surface
 Bacteria on raw food = ok, it will die during cooking
 Bacteria on ready-to-go foods = bad
 #### Prevention
 - Store food well - Refrigerate, proper temps,
 - Sealed tightly w/ lids - No bacteria in
 - Raw food away from ready-to-go foods - Ready to go foods do need cooking, and so wont kill the bacteria in it.
 - Different foods for each food group - Raw meat away from all
 - Wash hands - Wash regularly, just be safe basically
 - Avoid unnecessary contact with food - 
 - Keep cleaning things
 - Change/sanitise cleaning cloths
 - Air dry equipment and untensils
#### Risk
- Everyone is at risk but high risk: pregnant 

## Notes
### [What Is Cross Contamination? Plus, How to Avoid It (healthline.com)](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-cross-contamination#side-effects):
Cross-contamination = bacterial cc = transfer x bacteria, one place to another. 
Other contamination may be: chemicals allergen
Many happening places:
- Primary food production - Farms
- Slaughter and stuffs
- Secondary - processing and manufacturing
- transport
- storage
- distribution
- food prep
Types
- food - food
- equipment - food
- people - food

Food - food
contaimated + non-contaminated = cross-contam
Raw or unwashed food = many bacteria (bad)
leay greens, rce, milk, cheese, meats, eggs, poultry, sea foods
cotaminated lettuce in salad = cc
leftover in fridge is bad, 3-4 days

equipt - food
bacteria on surfaces like cutting boards
equipment + food = not good
no use raw meant and vege on same surface
food saftey education needed, all ages

ppl - food
clothes/skin to food
may not wash hands after coughing in
not enough ppl wash hands
cell phone/dirty towel/ dirty apron
food education = less bad handloing
wash hands, well

side effects

usually 24 hours, maybe weeks after
sometime vomiting, diarrhea -> need rehydration
severe = bloddy stools, fever, organ fails, death

who risky
literally everyone

store raw meat at bottom, no juices leakng
seperate for raw and eggs
proper temperatures
wash hands
wash equipment
different cut board for meat and veges
cook proper temps

dont wash raw
wash hands
cover raw stuff
use dish with lip
fish shelfish chicken bottom shelf fridge
raw and meat in bag differently
no using plastic bags (cant clean)

most common to for poisoning

### Key info
Bacterial contamination is the most common cause for food poisoning.
Can happen anywhere where food handling occurs, such as in farms and the production line, as well as your food preperation area.
Cross-contamination happens when a contaminated source comes in contact with an uncontaminated surface.
Can come from other foods or equipment or people
There are various side effects, some minor, such as stomache and headache, and some severe, such as organ failure and death.
This can happen to anyone, but pregnant women, children under the age of 5, people over the age of 65, and those with compromised immune systems are particularly vulnerable.
There are many things that can be done to prevent cross-contamination. e.g.:
- Place raw meat and eggs in a seperate bag from other foods when shopping.
- Don't use plastic bags as you cannot clean them, and you'll need to get another one.
- Cover raw foods during storage
- Place raw foods, poultry, fish, and shellfish below other foods in the bottom shelf of the fridge to prevent dripping.
- Use different cutting boards and other equipments when handling raw meats.
- Wash equipment well.
- Wash you hands well and regularly
- Use proper temperatures to store and cook foods.
