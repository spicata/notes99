*Occupational Health and Safety (OHS)* Act: passed **1984-12**, this assits workers and business owners by providing guidelines to follow to manage safety in the workplace. *WorkSafe* is the government agency in *Western Australia* that is part of the *Department of Commerce* that administers the Act. *WorkSafe* aims to reduce workplace fatalities and injury and disease rates in accordance with nation target.

Another types of health guideline is the *Work Health and Safety (WHS)*, used in other states. On **2012-01-01**, *WHS* and *OHS* began a merge in the states using this system. Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia are the only states that haven't fully adopted the *WHS* model yet.
