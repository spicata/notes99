Pogness #########- 90%

---
Today was a pog day. Only did 4 <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">pomodoros</mark> , but still. I didn't give <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Cornell Notes</mark> the credit it deserves. It is actually good. Much better than the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Zettlelkasten</mark> . Very good day. (I didn't do maths, life is pain). Oh yeah but I did badminton. I should send all the Zettelkasten to the Cornell.
