All the streetlights were out, they were never quite well-funded enough; the only light would be the dim quarter moon that barely lit up the surroundings, the dark midnight smog only worsening the situation. Despite that, Robert was able to navigate this street, he had memorised it's every crevice during the dozen years he had walked down it, always in the embrace of the dark night sky, when all else rest. Silence surrounded him, and only his featherlight footsteps ever reverberated down these streets.

On one particular day, Robert was interrupted by the sound of thumping, rather heavy, footsteps. It broke up the quietude of his calm, midnight walk.
