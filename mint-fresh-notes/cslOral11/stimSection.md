1. Hello! 

    1. ……你好。

1. This is my stimulus item; it is a picture of our friend group's chat room on an application known as Discrod.
    
    1. grammar point : 在, 跟……一起
    1. structure : 这是在A上我们做B的C (This is C where we do B on A)
    
1. Using this app, me and my friends chat to each other. 

    1. structure : 使用A，我们做B

1. We often do this when we have free time, and it is usually quite enjoyable.

    1. structure : 如果A的话，我们常常做B；我觉得很C

1. We just use it as a way to relieve stress from working, and we tell jokes and post funny images.

    1. 

1. This tend to get a little chaotic when Fred messages, however we keep him in the server (for some reason).

    1. 

1. To add to that, we also use this chat to study. We often share notes of what we learnt in class, we give each other problems or help others solve them, or we ask questions about studying.
1. We also have a different chat dedicated to chinese, which includes everyone on our table :-).
1. Sometimes, we use the chat room to arrange times when we all go onto a call and play games over the internet.
1. We used to often play Minecraft, however, since the start of Year 11, we have played less and less of it as we are all too buys studying.
1. However, I sometimes find that chatting with my friends uses too much of my time and I get distracted from my study.
1. For that reason, I only have this app on my phone, so that I may simply put it away if I get distracted.
1. All in all, this application allows me to 1) chat with my friends, 2) play games with my friends and sometimes organise other things, and 3) helps me study sometimes.
