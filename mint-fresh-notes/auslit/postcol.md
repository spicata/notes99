- Looking at the effects of colonialism (spec. eu colonial) on the world.
    - both pos and neg
- col is eu-centric
    - e.g. the values of the eu spread across the world
    - also eu values are commonly seen as univeral (universalism)
- decolisation is only seen as mil and political
    - however cultural influences
    - indigenous 'programmed' to believe that col values are good, original culture is bad (inferior) (double vision)
        - this double consciouness is unstable (sense of self).
        - heightened by forced migration (causes diaspora)
        - causes the feeling of being between, but not belonging to, two cultures
        - creates unhomeliness (Homi Bhabbha) != homeless, rather feeling lack of home while having a home (psychological refugee)
- orietalism relates to asia (but is an invention of the west)
    - asia depicted as x to show that west is y
    - y is usually a good thing
- also related to 'othering'
    - colonialism splits people into us (ingroup) and other (outgroup) (usually the colonised)
    - sometimes other people are depicted as brutal and savage (demonic other)
    - sometimes shown as beautiful due to their connection to nature (bcos of their primality) (exotic other)
- use of english itself is submitting to colonialism + not easy to rediscover past
    - also postcol identity is dynamic i.e. affected by both native and col cultures (a syncretism)
    - but also finding native identity is a matter of identity and purpose + resisting col culture. (nativism/nationalism)
- parallels feminism (+ postcol women)
