- Definition: At every point on a wavefront (of a wave), a semi-spherical wavelet in the direction of the wave. The next wavefront is perpendicular to all of the wavelets.
- Example: Use the same example in the [snell's law explainer](snellsExplainer.md)
- Explanation: The wavelets travel slower in a slower medium. This leads to a smaller distances between wavefronts and the ray of light bends towards the medium. Huygen's principle.
