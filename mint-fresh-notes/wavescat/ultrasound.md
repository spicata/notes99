- Most of the time, not all of the energy will be reflected. Instead, some if it will be reflected back. This is what happens in ultrasound imaging. By the law of reflection, we know that $\theta_{i}=\theta_{r}$. So, we can use this. This is an echo.

- Related I think: If you apply a form on energy to crystals, then it gets transferred to some electric energy. This is the piezoelectric effect
- Uses sound waves with a very high frequency, such as in the 20KHz to MHz range. It's called ultrasound cause it's like ultraviolet.
- Probes can be put into the body, or just on the skin.
