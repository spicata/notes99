- Snell's law can determine the angle of refraction.
- Using the angle of incidence and a materials' refractive indexes, the angle of refraction can be determined, and vice versa.
    - Instead of the refractive index, you could use the velocity of the wave in a substance.

$$\frac{\sin \theta_{1}}{\sin \theta_{2}}=\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}=\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}$$
