- With the beginning of Victorian age came new ideas in science, one of which being Darwin's theory of evolution.
- This created the question that, if it is possible that humans evolved from monkeys, is it possible for them to devolve back into monkeys, or any more primal humans.
    - This expression of more primal characteristics is known as atavism
    - It is also sometimes just racism.
