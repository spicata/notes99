- Gothic literature often takes place in strange, sometimes suspicious places, such as prisons, castles. It tends to be violet and dangerous, and sometimes sexually stimulating (what the hell).
- Conflict between time periods, such as the medieval and the Renaissance or sometimes even wildly different time periods, such as the ancient and the modern, and yet these two times are blended in order to create a cohesive setting.
