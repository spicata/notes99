# Henrik Ibsen:

- Very famous playwright (= dramatist)
- Norwegian 
- Father went bankrupt at an early age, apparently having a large influence on him.

## Hedda

- … liked manipulating people. (for some 'fun' (powerplay))
- The play itself is almost configured like a Greek tragedy.
    - The entire play occurs in a drawing/living room
    - Not too many people exist on the stage at once
    - Deaths are always shown offscreen.
- Hedda -> desire for freedom.
- Difference in the traditional male and female's role
    - Men were seen as active, rational, providers, protectors of the home
    - Women were seen as passive, nurturing, moral
    - Hedda is kind of none of this
- Henrik did a very good job at making a female character.

## Realism

- Early Realists was a philosophical school opposed to 'Nominalists'
    - Believed that there exists a true/perfect/absolute form of stuff (anything) that exists independently from objects.
- This way of thinking died down early 19th century
- 'let us replace sentimentalism by realism, and dare to uncover those simple and terrible laws which, be they seen or unseen, pervade and govern'.
- Realism tried to depict the *real* world as accurately and objectively as possible; showing how they truly exist. 
    - e.g. An interaction between characters feels and plays out like an actual interaction between people, and it isn't 'forced' to say.
- realism is explaining the world objectively (?!), rather than being idealistic about it
- In a word, lifelike.
- Tries to target things not covered as much, such as the lower classes.
- e.g. William Howells, Sinclair Lewis, HG Wells, Arthur Miller, etc.
- 'Revived' the English theatre.
- Does not try to 'reshape' the world in the text in any way, and rather shows it as it is. The characters within the play will change and grow, but the greater world which they live in stays essentially the same.
- Instead of looking to the rich and wealthy (usually), who had already been represented sufficiently in the literature, it looked towards the impoverished, as this was the way that the world was, and also because they were much less represented by other texts
    - This allowed them to not rely on what others had made which may have been sugarcoated.


## Naturalism

- naturalism is a more specific part of realism that goes late 19th century
- Studies the natural cause of things (disregarding supernatural and religious things)
    - Physical stuff you can interact with
    - What cannot be observed is not included, and it assumes that this is true.
- Darwin (again) and evolution can be seen as a method of natrual selection.
- hedda has some naturalistic aspects, but cannot be considered a naturalistic play (i think)
- Have a look at the 'natural world'. For reference, scientists are natural philosophers.
- Seen in opposition to supernaturalism (ghosts and things) or in the study of natural history i.e. biology.
