Important features of sin graphs (assuming similar ones exist for cos graphs too):
- Principal axis: horizontal line halfway between max and min values (i.e. the average I guess). Passes through all inflection points
- Amplitude: vertical distance between max value and principal axis
- Period: minimum horizontal distance between two points in period

Transformed y = sinx â†’ y = asin(b(x-c))+d:
- vertical dilation of a
- horizontal dilation of 1/b
- horizontal translation by c (to the right)
- vertical translation by d (to the up)
- Does the order matter? Yes. However, it is not as limiting as you might think. Translation just needs to come last

Also, the order in which you should probably find them:
1. Find d first (it is just the principle axis)
2. Find |a| next: this will be the amplitude. Sadly, you can't be sure whether a is positive or negative, because we can't be sure
3. Find b: this is 2pi/period
4. Find c.

Inflection points are where the concavity of the function changed from up to down, or vice versa. These can be horizontal points of inflection (when acceleration is 0), or could not be like that, as in a sin graph.

There are also tan graphs, and they are pretty wacky.
- Period of pi
- Has undefined/infinite amplitude
- Principle axis is still the one that goes through all the points of inflection

Literally the same was above but slightly different
