## creme's bunker

creme probably has a massive arctic cooler-like bunker under her house. where else would she be storing all of that ice-cream. we literally live in a desert.

## the fire

blue's house is surprisingly volatile. it is the only house in the town that continues to spontaneously combust all the time. it scares me that i live next to him, i always have to worry about the constant fire hazard. my guess would be that he continues to leave his bunsen burner on all the time. what a waste of town gas.

## dating

blue and pink are definitely dating.
