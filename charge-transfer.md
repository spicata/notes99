- Charge transfer from object A to object B
    1. Conduction i.e. charged particles (e.g. electrons) are physically transfer
        - Friction
        - Insulators have poor affinity for e- e.g. rubber, wood
        - Conductor have good affinity for e-
    2. Charging by induction 
    - inducing e- to move to create dipole
        - e.g. if you put a negatively charged thing near an object, the electrons in the object will repel, creating a dipole
- Discharge indicates two differently charged objects have neutralised difference in potential
