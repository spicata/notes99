oh no. there is nothing here! that's not good. 

now, other websites would chastise you and say something like "**you** seem lost", or "**you** are in the wrong place", or "this is not the web page **you** are looking for". they kind of place the blame on you for getting here. i hate that (and i am sure you hate it too), because nine times out of ten, we actually clicked a link and arrived there.

now i'm not like that. if you are here, it is most probably my fault. i am very sorry
