oh. uh... hi. welcome to the void between pages. you aren't really meant to see this. but you are here anyways, so welcome to the endless space between the little things you can see. yeah i'm also floating here. no clue why. i kind of just got lost and found myself here. you can definitely try to find you way back out, but i've already [got something for that (click on me)](index.md). but you could always linger here. see what goes on in the background. the little things floating around here. of course, if you managed to find your way here, something is definitely wrong, so tell me how you got here, and i'll make sure that doesn't happen again.
