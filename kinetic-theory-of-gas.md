When gas particles hit a the wall of the container they are in, they exert a certain force on it. Pressure is a measure of this (force per unit area i.e. N m-2).
- 1 Pa scal = 1 N m-2
- 1 atm osphere = 101.3 kPa

Kinetic theory of gas links the macroscopic (normal-size) properties of gas with their microscopic properties. 
- In macroscopic scale, gas is a phase of matter with a fixed mass, so-on-so-forth. 
- In microscopic scale, they are a collection of particles that move freely.

Ideal gases obeys all the equations perfectly, so used in theory. However, in practice, most gases will deviate from these equations in extreme condition viz. very low temperatures and very high pressures. Smaller particles viz. hydrogen and helium follow these laws most closely.

Some base-rules (these will differ depending on the source):
- Gases consist of identical molecules that move in straight, random, continual lines.
- Average distance between gas molecules is very large, so particles take up negligible volume
- Intermolecular and gravitational forces between molecules are negligible
- All collisions e.g. molecule with molecule, molecule with wall; are elastic collisions
- Pressure is due to collisions of the molecules with the walls
- Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules
- The internal energy inside the molecules is entirely kinetic
- Newton's Laws of Motion apply

Two different measures for temperature. Kelvin (absolute scale) is used for kinetic theory of gas. For conversion: Kelvin = Celcius + 273.15.

This can be used to explain lots of properties of gas:
- Gases diffuse quickly, because they gas particles move rapidly and randomly through the large amount of empty space
- Easily compressible, because of the large spaces between them
- Spread out easily, because there are no forces of attraction
- Exert pressures, because particles move rapidly and collide with walls
- Low densities, because there are large space between them

Said laws:
- [boil law](boyles-law)
- [charles'z law](charles-law)
- [combined gas law](combined-gas-law)
- [avocado law](avogadros-law)
- [universal gas constant](universal-gas-constant)

You don't need to know how to calculate them yet.
