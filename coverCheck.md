Pranav always goes on about **look, cover, write, check**. I thought he was insane, but then **he got 3 courses**. Then I read more stuff that **quizzing is the best way to learn**. Anki takes too long to make for most of us.

*Proposal*: Just fold our paper in half, write **word/term/anything on one side**, then write **definition on the other side**, then test.
