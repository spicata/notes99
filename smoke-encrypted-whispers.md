smoke signal:
- it seems to be a critique of the class division between the lower class and the higher and middle class, with the blue collar and white collar workers being synecdoches. It reveals the comfort of living in these rich suburbs, where one would not be scared for their own safety, nor plumed in smoke.
- A crow (singular), the death of nature at the hands of post-industrial society

tigerland:
- this prose-poem deals with the sense of identity and belonging, as well as being connected to the people around you, your family. the narrator reveals the influence that the common cheering of a sports team had on the family unit, with it effectively being able to bring together an entire crowd in camaraderie.
- on the other hand, it could be seen as the indoctrination of children into a greater cultural clash, where they are forced into supporting certain teams with the punishment of being estranged from the family if they did not. this overzealous nature could be seen when everything appeared to be like that sports teams when he looked around, from the colours of the sunset to the roads.

scared of the dark:
- going off of the last poem-prose too, ghosts and spirits is a pretty deeply running theme within indigneous culture, often respected. however, seeing it first through the manufactured setting around him, a far cry of the more social and natural setting that would have passed down these stories, scares him a little as seen in the title as well. this could be due to the re-presentation and interpretations of these stories by the colonisers, as the buses and lightbulbs, all are an effect of colonialism.

wecker road:
- wecker road, being on the fringe of his childhood — a very interesting choice of words that lends itself to being compared with a possible marginalisation — and the only unblocked road — which again might be in reference to this such as curfews, as seen in "only exit to brisbance" — might be referring to how the narrator himself was margnisalied form his society and limited to only a small area of real estate.
- all of the urban legends are average teenager tomfoolery, however, the last bit (the poem), stating that there was an unknown power around us possibly once again leading into the spirits.

cribb island:
- what i found most interesting was that last bit, where it said "Brisbane's least known burial site", or something along those lines. this is a clear reference to one of the numerous mass graves that litter Australia.
- I don't remember the rest of it... and I just read it lol
