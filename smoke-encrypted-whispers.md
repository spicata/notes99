hallo guys. wanna watch me absolutely lose it?

## of muse, meandering and midnight

for the wake and skeleton dance:
- From a surface level reading, it seems like the text is about the dying spirituality at the hands of Western rationality. Souls and spirits go hungry and broke.
- Dostoyevsky: A Russian author (writer of Crime and Punishment) who explores the human experience, particularly through struggle and hardship. The "recession in the spirit world" could be that hardship.

> Dostoevsky has often been viewed as the voice of the anonymous ... also figures the crisis of belief

- In this sense, Dostoevsky acts as the voice for the forgotten Indigenous Australians, which have gone missing or lost to history due to the impacts of colonisation and Western society.
- Also, like magic realism, aspects of magic and aspects of realism are placed next to each other, such as the apparitions of black dingoes, blurring the line between the supernatural and the real.
- It being payback for "bureaucrats in blacks skins" and the "fratricide troopers" is talking about fellow Indigenous Australians who have betrayed their fellow siblings and submitted to the Western system, leaving their siblings to die/killing their siblings themselves, and severing themselves from Indigenous culture.
    - i.e. those who have abandoned their own family, identity, and belonging in pursuit of power.

## smoke encrypted whispers

smoke signal:
- it seems to be a critique of the class division between the lower class and the higher and middle class, with the blue collar and white collar workers being synecdoches. It reveals the comfort of living in these rich suburbs, where one would not be scared for their own safety, nor plumed in smoke.
- A crow (singular), the death of nature at the hands of post-industrial society

tigerland:
- this prose-poem deals with the sense of identity and belonging, as well as being connected to the people around you, your family. the narrator reveals the influence that the common cheering of a sports team had on the family unit, with it effectively being able to bring together an entire crowd in camaraderie.
- on the other hand, it could be seen as the indoctrination of children into a greater cultural clash, where they are forced into supporting certain teams with the punishment of being estranged from the family if they did not. this overzealous nature could be seen when everything appeared to be like that sports teams when he looked around, from the colours of the sunset to the roads.

scared of the dark:
- going off of the last poem-prose too, ghosts and spirits is a pretty deeply running theme within indigneous culture, often respected. however, seeing it first through the manufactured setting around him, a far cry of the more social and natural setting that would have passed down these stories, scares him a little as seen in the title as well. this could be due to the re-presentation and interpretations of these stories by the colonisers, as the buses and lightbulbs, all are an effect of colonialism.

wecker road:
- wecker road, being on the fringe of his childhood — a very interesting choice of words that lends itself to being compared with a possible marginalisation — and the only unblocked road — which again might be in reference to this such as curfews, as seen in "only exit to brisbance" — might be referring to how the narrator himself was margnisalied form his society and limited to only a small area of real estate.
- all of the urban legends are average teenager tomfoolery, however, the last bit (the poem), stating that there was an unknown power around us possibly once again leading into the spirits.

cribb island:
- what i found most interesting was that last bit, where it said "Brisbane's least known burial site", or something along those lines. this is a clear reference to one of the numerous mass graves that litter Australia.
- I don't remember the rest of it... and I just read it lol

## misc.

monster:
- the constant repetition of "I am a Dreamtime monster" not only acts to drill line in particular into the heads of the reader, but also its reference to Frankenstein — an reference to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein — reflecting the mishmash nature of the narrator's cultural belief, mirroring the stitched together bundle of body parts that makes up Frankenstein's monster.

(Frankenstein is the name of the doctor, but I guess that would make the poem less poetic)

- also, the structure of the poem, with that line echoing throughout the entire text, could be reflective of the ways in which the narrator himself is constantly reminded of his unindigenousness.
- The narrator exists in a space between the two cultures, where he distances himself from the western culture by ripping out his Christian soul and not aligning himself with that side. However, he does not feel as though he is properly Indigenous, and is estranged from the side which he relates more strongly. (a hybrid between the two cultures, but not fully relating with either.)
- Powerful Indigenous symbols used throughout second stanza, things like the Indigenous flag and the song lines (which we conveniently learnt about today, would you look at that). However, reanimation and being colourblind is metonyms for being severed from one's own culture, and thus he is no longer able to appreciate his own culture to the fullest extent and understand them as such. 
- Seeing himself as a mutation of White Australia brings him into proximity with white australia, but at the same time emphasises how he has moved away from it, yet fails to bring him any closer to Indigenous australia.
