Every particle is moving. In a solid, it oscillates between a fixed point. You can plot this (Ek on N). Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of a substance (SI unit K).

=> See Maxwell-Boltzmann curve?

Energy can be added o a substance to increase kinetic energy of a system. This energy is 'energy in transfer' (q or Q), called heat. Energy flowing in would be a +ve heat. 

Internal energy (U) = Ek + Ep. Ep here is about what is in the system e.g. not gravity.
