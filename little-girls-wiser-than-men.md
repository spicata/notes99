*Little Girls Wiser Than Men* (1885) — originally called *Wisdom of Children* — is a short story by Russian author Leo Tolstoy, depicting a conflict that breaks out between two girls playing together, which quickly escalates, drawing a crowd; the girls quickly forget about it, and their fathers continue to argue, only to be stopped once the grandmothers intervene, noting how the girls are now, once again, having fun. Upon reading this text with a focus on the representations of different age groups — namely the children, the adults, and the elderly — one will be able to notice the aforementioned 'wisdom' that children and the elderly share; this is not shared by the adults, who are characterised as more active yet brash throughout this story.

Oftentimes, children are not only thought of as being naive, but also petty and childish. However, the story not only represents the children within it as aware of their own surroundings and situation, but also of possessing a degree of forgiveness and maturity that those around them can lack. This can be seen when Akoúlya reminds Malásha "... don't splash. Walk carefully!" The short yet direct syntactic structure as that often found in informal, colloquial speech establishes the situation as one that is rather carefree and playful. However, from this quote, it can also be found that Akoúlya is already knowledgeable enough to warn Malásha not to splash, knowing that if either of them is to get muddied, then they would get punished by their mothers. This awareness for their surroundings and situation is not shared by the adults, who in the heat of their argument, was dismissive of what the other party had to say, "every one shouting and no one listening". The contrast in actions taken by the children, and those taken by the adults, hints at the hidden awareness of the children. Likewise, once the adults had begun quarrelling, "Akoúlya had wiped the mud off her frock, and gone back to the puddle," and "Malásha joined her". The mud, of course, acts not only as the catalyst of the conflict, but is also, in a way, is symbolic of the conflict itself; once Akoúlya had wiped it off, the root of the problem is gone, and the two children continue to play. This simple act of forgiveness and forgetting reveals the more direct ways that the children think of problems: once a problem is gone, they are free to continue to have fun. Again, the adults become entangled with their own dignity, reputation, and emotions throughout their argument, and seemingly loses this quality, despite "fighting on account of these lassies". The surprising maturity of these children, and their straightforward and levelheaded responses to stimuli — particularly problems — rival those of the apparently mature adults. Or, as the title of the story implies, little girls are wiser than men.
