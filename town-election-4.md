I'll keep it short.

We don't know if a change will be good or bad before we make it. This was a reason politics ended in the Town, and it is also the reason it should be back.

Here are my proposed changes:
- Add more voice channels,
- Create other modes of communication,
- Change motif of the Discord server,
- Allow temporary member system,
- A new resource bank (e.g. Google Drive),
- A Town calendar and bulletin board,
- Reworking the constitution,
- Coloured roles,
- Organisation of real Town meetups,
- And more...
