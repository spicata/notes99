I'll keep it short.

We don't know if a change will be good or bad before we make it. This was a reason politics ended in the Town, and it is also the reason it should be back.

- Step 1: Setting up infrastructure
    - add more voice channels,
    - a new resource bank (e.g. Google Drive),
    - a Town calendar,
    - a town bulletin board,
    - reworking the constitution
- Step 2: New sheen
    - change motif of the Discord server,
    - *more* coloured roles
- Step 3: Making us of infrastructure
    - create other modes of communication,
    - allow temporary member system,
    - organisation of real Town meetups,
    - other town events
