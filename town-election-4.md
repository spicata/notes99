## plea

> Good changes are good. However, we don't know if a change is good before we implement it.

Considering Edward's resignation, the coup during Shan-mei's mayorship, and my dictatorship that came before that, it makes sense that people would rather stick to the status quo then try to change. We don't know if a change will be good before we make it, it might end up hurting the Town and its people. This is **a** reason politics have died in the Town.

However, this is also the reason I want it to come back. The Town could be better, we could have a better community, better resources, and better management (the first one is the BIGGEST priority). We just need to first make changes to do so.

## changes

There are some changes that I want to implement into the Town. I am choosing to run for mayor so that I can personally supervise them:
- Change the motif of the Discord server to a park rather than a Town. Seems to be more fitting as an analogy, as a place where people can hang out, chat, and do activities, and also as a community hub of sorts. Additionally, having it be the Town seems to create confusion; the Town (Discord server) and the Town (as a concept/community) are blurred. 
- Look into creating other parks that can act as other community hubs, especially for people who can't really use Discord as a means of communication, like Kiefer and Donal. At the moment, this is not much of a problem, however, could broaden the horizons further into the future.
- Adding more voice channels. To be frank, 1 does usually work fine, however, having 2 or 3 seems to be a little better, as the current voice channel is usually used for general speaking. Sometimes, specific cases will crop up, things such as Japanese speaking practice, which should be in a different vc from general discussion. In other words, be able to run different conversation topic concurrently.
- Much like Loren and Ethan, there are people who originally joined without a website who ultimately ended up joining the Town, and I think the Town has benefited because of people like them. Also, most of the older Town members (post-coalition but before the new ones) have also been in an area like this as their websites were being set up. **So, adding a temporary member system** might benefit the Town (normal Town members will be given a different role to distinguish).
- Going beyond the Discord server, there are other things I want to make for the Town, such as a collective resource Google Drive (not Onedrive because it's a little... dodgy), where people can upload things like: videos, voice recordings, other file formats, past papers, and additional resource, to be shared among the Town members. This should hopefully also make the Town a little more useful, because I'm aware that some people just use the Town as a resource more than a community
- We have a [constitution](https://constitution.toomwn.xyz/), however, it is quite dodgy, and does not work to properly set up limitations for... well... anything really. We have intentional loopholes that are still left in, very vague ideas, and lots of other scuffed things. Also, it feels like it was made to run a company, rather than a community. Planning on reworking the entire thing so that it better reflects the Town community and so it actually sets up proper limitations and other things. Draft in process. (I guess a better word might be manifesto)

Still open to other ideas, and if you have complaints about some of these changes, feel free to comment on them, so that we can work something out to fix them.

## credentials

I am not a fan of getting elected based on credentials, because ultimately, I think that people should be voted in based on the things they can bring to the table. However, I can still acknowledge the importance of those credentials, so:
- The oldest continuous member of the Town, and has seen most of its histories, including all their ups and downs.
- Had been mayor before, albeit not without its own controversies.
- Runs spicata99 and xob99 and the Town directory, I guess?
