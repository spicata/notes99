    <h1>404: File not found</h1>
    <p>It appears that this file is missing, or rather, more likely deleted (sorry about that). Here are some possible fixes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Actually check if the link is correct</li>
      <li>If the link is a little older, it might be on the archive site (<a href="https://archive.99000000.xyz">https://archive.99000000.xyz/</a>)</li>
    </ol>
