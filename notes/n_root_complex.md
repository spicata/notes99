| Thing | Roots | # solutions |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| x^2   | -1, 1 | 2           |
| x^3   | 1     | 1           |
| x^4   | -1, 1 | 2           |
| x^5   | 1     | 1           |
| ...   | ...   | ...         |

But we have more solution in the **complex plane**

$$\begin{align}
x^{4}-1&=0 \\
(x^{2})^{2}-1^{2}&=0 \\
(x^{2}-1)(x^{2}+1)&=0  \\
(x-1)(x+1)(x-i)(x+i)&=0 \\
x=\pm 1\text{ or }x=\pm i
\end{align}$$

The 4th power has 4 solutions in the complex plane.

$$\begin{align}
x^{3}-1&=0 \\
(x-1)(x^{2}+x+1)&=0 \\
(x-1)\left(x +\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}i \right)\left(x +\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}i \right)&=0
\end{align}$$

3rd power has 3 solutions in the complex plane.

## theorem

including complex numbers, the total number of nth roots of 1 is n. the roots all have modulus 1, and are spaced at angular intervals of 2pi/n (i.e. they form an n-gon)

more generally, for any complex number z, there are n nth roots of z. all the modulus and angular intervals are the same.
