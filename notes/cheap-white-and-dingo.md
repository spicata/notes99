## content

- *cheap white goods at a dreamtime sale*: **appropriation** (inappropriate usage of), **commercialisation** (making money from), and subsequent **devaluation** (marginalisation/unworthy) of Indigenous culture.
- *the dingo lounge*: **devaluation** and **destruction** of Indigenous culture, **loss and estrangement** from one's home

Context for *cwg*: historical context of cultural appropriation as well as commercialisation. Also, impacts of capitalism on Indigenous culture, possibly the echoes of colonialism. Do:
- [x] Definition of cultural appropriation
    - Cultural appropriation is the inappropriate or unacknowledged adoption of an element or elements of one culture or identity by members of another culture or identity
- [ ] How does that play into it?

Ideology for *dl*: postcolonial theory of unhomeliness and liminal spaces. Dingo lounge is unhomely, as well as a liminal space inhabited by lycanthropes.
- [x] Define unhomeliness
    - The feeling of being unhomed while still having a home, different to being homeless entirely.
    - To be more specific, this is seen by how the shapeshifters skulk around the dingo lounge, 'skulk' carries with it connotations of uncomfortability which indicates that they feel out of places or as strangers within the dingo lounge (which belongs to them).
- [x] Define liminal spaces
    - liminal means to occupy a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold; or is relating to a transitional or initial stage of a process.
    - lycanthropes are hybrids between humans and animals

Overlaps: both of them are touch on commercialisation and devaluation of Indigenous culture.

## examples

5 locations: London, Swiss back, Paris, Manhattan, Soho. These are all eucoentric icons of materalism, consumerism and capitalism. Compare this with the Indigenous counterpart: Uluru. "bare", "brutal", "bohemian".
