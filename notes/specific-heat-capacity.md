Specific heat capacity is the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of 1kg of a substance by 1K. Equation:

$$Q=mc\Delta T$$

- Q is in joules.
- m ass (kg)
- specific heat c apacity (J kg^-1 k^-1)
- change in delta T emperature (K (or C))

SHC is different for different substances. Also different for different states of some substance. e.g. 

- Cwater = 4.18\*10^3 J K^-1 kg^-1
- Cice = 2.10\*10^3 J K^-1 kg^-1
- Csteam = 2.00\*10^3 J K^-1 kg^-1
