*a quick look into the mistakes i made in heating and processes. oopsies*

The lid of a vacuum flask stops the hot air inside from escaping into the atmosphere, and vice versa. A better way to explain the prevention of heat transfer by convection than the vacuum between the layers. (1)

Specify that it goes from liquid → solid, or gas → liquid. (1)

Define kinetic theory as all particles being in constant motion, unless at absolute zero (1). Also, should have offered a simple practical solution (1) (me personally, i forgot to read it).

Misunderstood. The problem is the fact that when the beads are fished out from the water, they are wet. This will throw off the result. (3)

Include the +- AU. (1)
