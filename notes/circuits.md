* electrons, hence negative charge, moves around an electrical circuit (+ve charge does *not move*)
* but... conventional current means the flow of +ve charge (hell yeah)
* current means conventoanl current in assessments
* electorn current means the flow of -ve (electrons)
* allow the flow of electric charge to transform electric Ep to other forms e.g. heat, sound, light

## components of electrical circuits

* power source - supplies electrical potential difference (p.d./voltage/em.f.), causing e- from -ve terminal toward +ve terminal e.g. battery, powerpoint
* charges in motion = current e.g. proton all the way from ehaven
* wires: copper, silver, gold
* device/component/resistor, i.e. that which converts electrical energy

## misc.

* ammeter measures current (amp-ere-s, I)
* voltmeter measures p.d./voltages (V) in volts (V)
* galvanometer: very sensitive ammeter, deprecated
* resistors create resistors (don't fry things)
* variable resistor i.e. rheostat
