    <h1>literature question sets</h1>

      <p>The task is to discuss the following questions with a partner. Sadly, I don’t have a partner today, so here we go by myself…</p>

<p><strong>What is [Indigenous Australian Culture]?</strong> Probably the (many different) cultures that Indigenous Australians have, both prior to and post European colonisation. Much like Western or Asian culture to that extent. Culture (in my opinion) is also an important aspect of society.</p>

<p><strong>Why is it important?</strong> As I said, culture is an important binder for society, but also for creating identity. Culture also informs decisions and viewpoints, a person within a certain culture (or subculture for that matter) would probably hold wildly different values and attitudes from another person in a different culture.</p>

<p><strong>Why about history?</strong> History could be a way that people learn of cultures, especially through the study of the mutations and other transformations that certain cultures have. Additionally, key historical events (e.g. the Stolen Generation, WW2, Industrial Revolution) would heavily impact the relevant cultures.</p>

<p><strong>What is the modern world?</strong> The modern world is the world at its current situation, and a little before and after that. It will change with time.</p>

<p><strong>What is globalisation?</strong> Globalisation is a trend particularly in the modern world where people and nations grow more and more connected. Such as exchanges of culture, trade deals, and exports. People become more and more reliant on others from other places in the world.</p>

<h2 id="cold-storage">cold storage</h2>

<p>Poetic Language:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“ice”, “cold”, “cryogenic”, “chilling”: lexical chain full of ‘cold’ diction, showing the slowing down of a society.</li>
  <li>“loses … to the lust of the city”:</li>
  <li>””</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increasing urbanisation that saps the youth out of towns in the outskirts of the city.</li>
  <li>A literal marginalisation of presumably lower class citizens of a country (assumptions based on the fact that the live on the outskirts of the city)</li>
  <li>Continuing conflict between white and black citizens</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
