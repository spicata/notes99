Exams are devastating. So, better to not make the same mistakes I do.

---

## Question 11

> Consider the follow substances: NH4Cl, Cl2, Br2, ICl. which of the following correctly ranks the substances in order of decreasing boiling point?

NH4Cl has a higher boiling point than ICl, so the order is NH4Cl > ICl > Br2 > Cl2.

---

## Question 16

> Lewis was revisiting his notes on nanotechnology for his upcoming Chemistry exam and found the following points in his notes:  
> 1. Nanoparticles have a very large surface area to volume ratio, compared to bulk materials.
> 2. Nanoparticles have properties that vary from the bulk material.
> 3. Nanoparticls are structures with at least one dimension in the range of 1-100 um.

Only 1 and 2 are true, as um is **micrometres**, not nanometres.

---

## Question 26b

> Compare and contrast the structure of an atom of xenon-133 with the more common isotope xenon-131.

Compare: both have 54 protons and 54 electrons.

Contrast: one has 77 neutrons and the others have 79 neutrons.

---

## Question 27a

> Explain how lead can conduct electricity as a solid and a liquid.

Solid and liquid lead have delocalised electrons. When potential difference is applied, electrons can flow through the structure. The flow of charged particles is a current of electricity.

Key term: carriers of charge

---

## Question 27c

> Use you understanding of the structures of graphite and diamond to explain why both substances have a very high melting point, but have significantly different electrical conductivity as solids.

Both have a high melting point because they are covalent molecules. Many covalent bonds hold atoms together, which would require a large amount of energy to break. Graphite is a good conductor of electrictiy as its structure has delocalised electrons. Diamond is a poor conductor of electricity as all the electrons are fixed in covalent bonds.

## Question 29c

> On the grid below, plot a graph to show the trend in atomic radius for the elements in period 2 of the period table.

Use a curve of best fit, not a line of best fit.

---

## Question 30a

> Explain, in terms of bond-breaking and bond-making, why this reaction is endothermic.

Bond breaking is endothermic. Bond making is exothermic. More energy is required to break the bonds that are needed to form them. Hence, the reaction is endothermic.

---

## Question 30b

> In terms of the system and surroundings, describe the energy transformation and energy transfer that takes places during this reaction.

It was transferred from heat energy to enthalpy.

---

## Question 30c

> Use the enthalpy profile diagram to estimate the activation energy and the enthalpy change for this reaction

Be. More. Specific.

---

## Question 32a

> A piece of nickel is added to a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid.

H2.

NB: Cross through your working.

---

## Question 32c

> Solutions of cobalt (II) chloride and sodium carbonate are mixed.

A pink solid.

---

## Question 33d

> Use collision theory to explain how increasing the temperature increases the rate of reaction.

Increased temperature increases average kinetic energy of particles. Increased velocity increases frequency of collisions. More collisions with sufficient kinetic energy to overcome activation energy increases proportion of all collisions that are successful.

---

## Question 34a

> Daniel drew the three structures of the hydrocarbons. Name the substances drawn.

It is cyclohexane.

---

## Question 34d

> Suggest what the similarity and difference between the observation would be.

Similarity: All three would combine colourless liquid and clear orange liquid to produce a clear colourless liquid.

---

## Question 34f

> Could Aden's hydrocarbon be one of the molecules Daniel and Angela were investigating? Justify your conclusion.

No. The empirical formula does not make CH2, which is the empirical formula for Daniel and Angela's hydrocarbons.

---

## Question 35a

> Write a stepwise method that Shyna could use to separate the precipitate of silver chloride from the solution, ensuring the silver chloride solid is pure and ready for weighing. Name any equipment used in your procedure.

1. Filter mixture through filter paper and funnel.
2. Wash the residue in filter paper.
3. Dry residue completely.

## Question 36a

> Butane has a much higher vapour pressure than ethanethiol. Use your knowledge of intermolecular forces to explain this observation.

Butane only forms dispersion forces. Ethanethiol forms dispersion forces and dipole-diple forces. The sum of intermolecular forces in ethanethiol is greater. Less ethanethiol evaporates at a given temperature, so lower vapour pressure.

---

## Question 36b

> The boiling point of ethanethiol is 35'C, whereas the boiling point of ethanol is 78'C. Explain why ethanol has a higher boiling point than ethanethiol.

Ethanethiol forms dispersion forces and dipole-dipole forces. Ethanol also forms hydrogen bonds. Sum of intermolecular forces in ethanol is greater. More heat energy needed to break.

---

## Question 36c

> Ethanethiol is not soluble in water, whereas ethanol is highly soluble in water. Explain this observation.

Ethanethiol can't form hydrogen bonds in water by ethanol does. Intermolecular forces between molecules of itself must be broken to dissolve. Also, intermolecular forces between molecules of the solvent and the solute must be formed to dissolve. The intermolecular forces formed in a solution of ethanol and water are sufficiently strong to overcome intermolecular forces between ethanol.

---

## Question 36d

> Draw and label a diagram to show the **strongest** intermolecular forces formed in a solution of ethanol and water.

Hydrogen bonds are shown bonding hydrogen and lone electron pair of oxygen. δ+ and δ- are shown.

---

## Question 36f

> Another gas with a similar smell to ethanethiol is dihydrogen sulfide. It can be produced by the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfide powder. Write an equation for this reaction, showing only reacting species, and including state symbols.

Na2S is a solid. Hence, the full thing must be included in the equation.

---

## Question 37f

> Using relevant chemical equations and your understanding of acids, justify your selections in part (e).

Show the equations:

$$CH_{3}COOH_{(aq)}\rightleftharpoons H^{+}_{(aq)}+CH_{3}COO^{-}_{(aq)}$$
$$HNO_{3 (aq)}\to H^{+}_{(aq)}+NO^{-}_{3 (aq)}$$
$$H_{2}SO_{4 (aq)}\to 2H^{+}_{(aq)}+SO^{2-}_{4 (aq)}$$

---

## Question 37g

> Describe how the term 'concentrated' is different from the term 'strong' in the context of acidic solutions.

Concentrated: large number of moles of substance dissolved per volume of solution.
