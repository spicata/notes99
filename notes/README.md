# spicata's notes (notes99)

notes99 is one of the three subdomainds that I intend to use from now on, alongside articles99 and spicata99. As expected, notes99 is the subdomain that will be used for notes publishing.

These notes, however, are not completely completed. These are my "workng notes", and they are primarily intended to be used by me, and usually by me only. If you find these notes useful, that is great, however, you are not the primary audience.

Despite that, if you manage to find problems with the notes, please always feel free to contact me at one of my contacts and inform me, so that I can fix it.

As always, thank you for your time, and have a nice day.
