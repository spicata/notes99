An argument needs to have a reason, an inference (e.g. "therefore"), and a conclusion (i.e. find a causal relationship).

Thus, reason --- (so) --→ conclusion. This is provable by logic.

If we flip it around, then we get an explanation. So... conclusion --- (because) --→ reason. This is not provable by logic.

If an argument is deductively valid: if P, then Q. *If it is raining, then there must be clouds. Because it is rainy, so there are clouds.* But deductively valid does not need to be true. *If my hand is itchy, then I will win the lottery*.

## breakdown

> I think Marvel makes bad movies

What are the problems here?

1. There is no reason. Why does Marvel make bad movies.
2. It is an opinion. It is not falsifiable. I can show you that Marvel doesn't make bad movies, but you might still think that.
    1. Unless I gaslight you or something.

Also.

> Marvel films are formulaically generated for mass appeal and profit, lacking the substance of older films with strong artistic vision.

1. Define 'formulaically generated for mass appeal' and 'lacking ... strong artistic vision'
2. Prove that Marvel films are formulaically generated and that the older films have strong artistic vision.
3. Why does this make it bad???
