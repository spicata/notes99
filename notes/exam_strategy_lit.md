*some of the exam strategies we have to prepare*

Exam strategy number A:

> Question 5: Consider how reading **a text** in a particular way has shaped your response to the people, places or ideas it explores.

You can do this question on *Hedda Gabler*, reading a text through a feminist lens.

> Question 10: With reference to **one or more poems** you have studied, consider whether it is possible for a text's aesthetic value to outweigh its intellectual merit.

You can do (my *favourite* Romantic poem) *Kubla Khan*. Because, yes.
