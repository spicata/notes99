Here is a short article on why I dislike categories:

What do I mean by categories? Well, probably just the definition given by Google...

> a class or division of people or things regarded as having particular shared characteristics.

Categories are usually okay, but people care too much about these categories that they begin to get in the way of things. An example would be like the names of voice channels in our Discord server viz. call and study. From my point of view, this is worse than just calling them 'call 1' and 'call 2'. 

Despite being more descriptive, it is also much more limiting. Whereas there can be two regular calls/two study calls/one of each in the vc's called '1' and '2'. The same *could* be true for 'call' and 'study', but they are more restricting.

tl;dr: categories are both descriptive and limiting. Sometimes better to just let people figure things out and create their own rules.
