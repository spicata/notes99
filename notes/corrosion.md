title: corrosion of metals

I think I might be going rusty. And so is Blaze™.

Dry/direct corrosion is when the metal reaction occurs with oxygen from the air, to make a metal oxide. It forms a protective layer on the surface of the metal, which protects the rest of the metal (passivation: making the metal unreactive because surface layer). Aluminium and chromium form a protective layer, so it's useful.

Like when sodium reacts with air.

Wet/indirect corrosion is when a metal reaction occurs with oxygen (air) and water. What the hell?

$$\begin{align}
Fe_{(s)}\to Fe^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^{-} \\
Fe^{2+}_{(s)}\to Fe^{3+}_{(aq)} + e^{-}
\end{align}$$

## rates

These factors will change the rate of rusting...

- concentration of oxygen - more oxygen → more reactions
- temperature - increase kinetic energy, but solubility of oxygen decreases
- pH - acidic solutions increases the rate of rusting
- conductivity of aqueous solution - it will increase the rate of rusting, somehow

## prevention

- If you cover it in a sacrifical metal, it will get corroded instead, so the thing you want won't get rusted.
- Any physical layers will prevent rust, so things like paint and plastic. Oils and grease also works.
- Alloying
- Cathodic protection

### tinning

This includes coating iron or steel in a thin layer of tin. The tin will oxidise, and it will passivate the surface. But... also if it's damaged, the iron will corrode. (It is a noble layer)

## galvanizing

This includes coating iron or steel in a thin layer of zinc. Zinc oxidises more readily, and so it is a sacrifical layer.

## cathodic protection

Turn that galvanic cell into a electrolytic cell (see [electrochemical cells](electrochemical_cells.md))

## stainless steel

Stainless steel is a alloy, including chromium. Chromium is more reactive than iron, and so it will oxidise first.
