The number line:
<---------------------------------------------------->

But we can't put complex numbers here!!! So what do we do?

                            ^
                            |
                            |
       (-12, 3i).           |
                            |
                            |
<---------------------------|--------------------------->
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            v

The number plane (argand diagram) (complex plane). Like a Cartesian plane but for number line and complex.

All real numbers are just in the complex plane, if you think about it. Now we have: N > Z > Q > R > C. Real numbers are just sepcial complex numbers.

                            ^
                            |    ^ (3, 12i)
                            |   /
                            |  /
                            | /
                            |/
<---------------------------|--------------------------->
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            |
                            v

You can also think of them as vectors. Addition and subtraction does the same as vector addition.

You can also apply... transformations? If you apply any complex number by -1, you rotate it by 180deg. Rotate it by i to rotate it 90deg counterclockwise.
