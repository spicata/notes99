<p>Feminism is the <span class="small-date">(1)</span class="small-date"> advocacy of women’s rights on the basis of the <span class="small-date">(2)</span class="small-date"> equality of the sexes. Women are a marginalised group. A patriarchy is the societal system run by and for men.</p>

<p>Feminism comes in waves. First wave feminism was particularly concerned with being equal under the law. This included suffrage for women, which would give them the right to vote. Second wave feminism was more concerned with de facto inequalities. These were mainly social inequalities. The third wave has had much more fuzzy boundaries.</p>

<h2 id="flavours">flavours</h2>

<p>Radical feminism comes about due to the belief that the oppression of women is created primarily through sexism and the patriarchy. Radical-cultural feminism, also known as cultural feminism, is a branch that believes that women hold superior qualities than men.</p>

<p>Marxist feminism is more focused on the class divisions, and how the capitalist system works to oppress women.</p>

<p>Liberal feminism does not want the entire structure to change, but instead integrate women better into the structure in a way that both sexes are equal. The first wave of feminism is an embodiment of liberal feminism. Think of it like moderate feminism in comparison to radical feminism.</p>

<p>Difference feminism sees women as <span class="small-date">(not a single and homogeneous group)</span class="small-date">, but rather as a group of different interests and beliefs. <span class="small-date">(Maybe because feminism used to treat the white, middle-class woman as the standard woman?)</span class="small-date"></p>

<p>Black feminism is feminism crossed with racism. Founded on this idea of intersectionality i.e. different oppressions can overlap to produce a greater oppression.</p>

<p>Eco-feminism is feminism that posits that the oppression of women is not only destructive socially, but also detrimental to the environment. Mother nature…</p>

<p>Transnational feminism is concerned as how globalisation and capitalism impacts all different women.</p>
