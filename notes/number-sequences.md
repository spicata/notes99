Sequences of numbers are exactly what you think. e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... . They are called t1, t2, t3, t4, t5. t stands for term.

You can define sequences with a recursive formula. Only needs the first term and a pattern. Example: t1 = 2, tn = t(n-1) + 2. Hence, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... . Similarly, Fibonnaci is t1 = 1, t2 = 2, tn = t(n-1) + t(n-2).
