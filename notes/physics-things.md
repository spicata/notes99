Series:
- When components are in series, current is same in all parts
- If components are added, then current is reduced
- Vdrop is around EMF
- Total Vdrop = sum of individual Vdrops

Parallel:
- Total current = sum of all currents flowing through each path
- Voltage in each path will be the same

Ohm's law: Inverse relation between V and I.
- When I-V is linear, the device is ohmic
- When I-V is not linear, then device is non-ohmic
- In series: Rt is sum of all R's
    - Because V = IRt = IR1 + IR2 + IR3 + ... (which you can cancel out the I)
- In parallel: Re = (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3)^-1
    - Because I = V/Rt = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3 + ... (which you can cancel out the V)
