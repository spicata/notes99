Apps like Wix and Squarespace are very good, they allow non-coders to create websites. However, the also lock you into their respective application. Imagine a no-code application that allows you to export it as a HTML/CSS files, so that you could use things like Github pages. That would be pretty cool.

Of course, if it already exists, email me the link please.
