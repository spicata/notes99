## electrical safety (for the exam)

Fuse offers more resistance than the rest of the wiring. Thus, it will also heat up more. If too much current runs through it, it will melt the fuse. The wiring is now cut.

RCD (residual current device) monitors wire for differences. If difference, then it cuts circuit in microseconds. Saves houses and lives.

and also insulation and double insulation (no open wires please)

```
In our country:
 active -> / \ <- neutral
   earth -> |

In other countries:
 o o or _ _
         |
```
