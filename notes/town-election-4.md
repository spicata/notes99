Good morning Town!

So, when I first started my website, I came across an article that said "be the resource that you've always wanted" (or something like that), and that has been the general principle ever since. Similarly, I have not been the most happy with the current management of the Town (especially since he started 'playing' with his powers), so I've decided to run for mayor.

Unlike the previous mayorships, this will bring some major changes to the Town, especially on the side of management. Changes include: reworking the constitution to be more intuitive and easy to understand, as well as clarifying many things; creating a code of etiquette; and so on.

The biggest change to the constitution will probably be a reworking of our democratic processes. The idea is that every mayor will have a term length (say... 1 month), and at the end of that term, another election will be held; this will make the elections a reoccurring (and large) event in the Town, so get ready for that. However, anyone can run for mayor, and the current mayor can also renew their term limit during that election, so if you are a good mayor, people will be able to keep you in. Finally, we will be keeping the idea of the snap-votes, albeit in an altered format. Instead, now we will have a vote of no confidence, which can be run when you see the mayor to be unfit, but will require a supermajority (~75%) in order to pass.

All of these changes will be done in order to make getting a leadership role in the Town more intuitive and not as bureaucratic as it currently is.

Also, I *do* have plans to bring in a code of conduct, especially to keep the people in power in check, although that may be changed based on public opinion.

So, vote for me if you want to see these changes and more.
