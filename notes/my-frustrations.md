*a wistful morning. storms brewing in the horizon. unforgiving sun rising from its slumber.*

dust. it's all just dust. just sand and sorrow for as long as this desert spans, and a sorry excuse for a town, one built on foundations of sand. and to have believed that this little flame in this eternal scrap would never go out.

i don't know. i'm just frustrated. the town that stands in front of us now, it's no longer the town that i fell in love with all the time ago. to think that it once had character and colour, all built upon a shared dream of collaboration and communication. i just feel it lacks that romantic air that was present all that time ago. and yeah, anonymous is over there painting his garden anew, and shan-mei's learning how to decorate her house, but it still feels to sterile and dead.

it doesn't seem to have that spark it once carried; no aspirations or grander goals in mind. everyone's just doing what they always do, always sitting in the valley of comfort. there's no new innovations, or any wild ideas. it lacks any charisma or charm. it's almost like that metropolis we wanted to escape from all that time ago.

oh how it felt to take our own destinies into our hands and shape a collective path that we could all take. and how it felt for new settlers to come join; setting up a new house often being a group effort. it lacks that cohesion now, and i dunno what to do without it.

maybe it's all the new settlers that we wrangled from the metropolis, who brought their cookie-cutter goals and values of success. they say that they are upholding the status quo, but it just feels like we are embracing entropy and stagnation. maybe it's the loss of one of our most important friend and ally. he was always there for us, for me, but i wasn't there for him when i needed to be. he might have been right, the environment we've made, that i've made, is not conducive to progress. i don't know, and i don't know if i should care.

it seems everything's drifted away. the name jacky zhao is just the name of another celebrity, and not a role model and idol that we once aspired to be. andy matuschak is but a whisper in the wind, and maggie appleton is nowhere to be seen. role models who once held such respect has become nothing but a name, and it's saddening.

who knows. maybe my expectations of them were too high, and maybe i was just chasing dreams. but the town does feel different now, i can feel it in my core. i'm not sad, not even angry. just disappointed, and a little frustrated.
