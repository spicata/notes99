First of all. What is happening (plot)? Who is the text about (characters)? Where and when is it happening (setting)?

Second of all. Technical things, like language devices, structure, style, genre, descriptive language, generic techniques.

Third of all. Finally, your reading. What are the consequences of character's actions. How are people represented. Where are our sympathies directed? Who is empowered? What are the symbols? How about context?
