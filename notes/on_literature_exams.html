      <p><em>teacher’s lecture which was remixed for <del>your</del> my enjoyment</em></p>

<p><span class="small-date">(<em>cue the advertisement music</em>)</span class="small-date"></p>

<p>Do YOU think that writing poetry for the close reading is the best choice because <span class="small-date">(1)</span class="small-date"> writing it for the extended response is difficult and <span class="small-date">(2)</span class="small-date"> poetry is easiest for the close reading section? Well, introducing Some Reasons to Reconsider™.</p>

<p>Number 1: Writing poetry for extended response? Well, when it comes to poetry — because of the use of meter, rhythm, and rhyme — you can memorise entire poems. Why be limited to the quotes you have memorised when you can just remember the entire poem?</p>

<p>Number 2: You can do proses <span class="small-date">(and drama)</span class="small-date"> for close reading easily. Just do <a href="/notes/narrative-devices">narrative conventions</a>. It’s as easy as that. For some more details…</p>

<ul>
  <li>They can be flat or round <span class="small-date">(complexity)</span class="small-date">, static or dynamic <span class="small-date">(change)</span class="small-date">. They are sometimes stereotypes and sometimes archetypes, sometimes foils too. They are… <span class="small-date">(<em>drumroll</em>)</span class="small-date">… Characters!
    <ul>
      <li>Constructed through what they Say, what Others say about them, what they Do, and how they Appear. SODA.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Settings can be spatial or temporal. They make the atmosphere.</li>
  <li>Ah, point of view. When they’re 1st, its intimate <span class="small-date">(but sometimes unreliable)</span class="small-date">; when 3rd limited, a tad more distant; when 3rd omniscient, it gives you many perspectives. <strong>We don’t talk about 2nd.</strong></li>
  <li>Plot is linear and non-linear. And they go: exposition, rising action, climax, denouement, resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="small-date">(If you request, I can probably try to make notes on narrative conventions)</span class="small-date"></p>

<p>Continuing Number 2: Any figurative language — and many other poetic devices — can usually also be used for prose.</p>
