Do YOU think that writing poetry for the close reading is the best choice because (1) writing it for the extended response is difficult and (2) poetry is easiest for the close reading section? Well, introducing Some Reasons to Reconsider™.

Number 1: Writing poetry for extended response? Well, when it comes to poetry — because of the use of meter, rhythm, and rhyme — you can memorise entire poems. Why be limited to the quotes you have memorised when you can just remember the entire poem?

Number 2: You can do proses (and drama) for close reading easily. Just do [narrative conventions](/notes/narrative-devices). It's as easy as that. For some more details...

- They can be flat or round (complexity), static or dynamic (change). They are sometimes stereotypes and sometimes archetypes, sometimes foils too. They are... (*drumroll*)... Characters!
    - Constructed through what they Say, what Others say about them, what they Do, and how they Appear. SODA.
- Settings can be spatial or temporal. They make the atmosphere.
- Ah, point of view. When they're 1st, its intimate (but sometimes unreliable); when 3rd limited, a tad more distant; when 3rd omniscient, it gives you many perspectives. **We don't talk about 2nd.**
- Plot is linear and non-linear. And they go: exposition, rising action, climax, denouement, resolution.

(If you request, I can probably try to make notes on narrative conventions)

Continuing Number 2: Any figurative language — and many other poetic devices — can usually also be used for prose.
