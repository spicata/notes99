When the temperature increases, each particle will have more kinetic energy, thus colliding will more walls and other particles, which increases the pressure. However, at a constant pressure, this will instead result in the volume increasing.
- Charles' Law: at constant pressure, the volume of a fixed quantity of gas is proportional to its absolute temperature
- V1/T1 = V2/T2. Temperature must be in Kelvin
