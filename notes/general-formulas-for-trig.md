If you plot y=cosx on a graph, then you will get a function that goes in the direction of the x-axis. On the other hand, if we want y=cos^-1 x, we can think of it as x=cosy. Plot this, and this will follow the y-axis. However, this is not a function, because it fails the vertical line test.

If you restrict the range to 0 <= y <= pi, then you will get a function. Apply similar to sin^-1 and tan^-1.

> What is the ranges for sin^-1 and tan^-1?

- sin^-1 has a range of -pi/2 to pi/2
- tan^-1 has ditto

By convention, all the functions only have 1 solution.

- For cos, the solution is $k2\pi\pm \cos^{-1} (x)$
- for sin, the solution is "$k2\pi+\sin^{-1}(x)$" or "$(2k+1)\pi-\sin^{-1}(x)$"
- For tan, the solution is $k\pi+\tan^{-1} (x)$

This is formal, but the other one works as well (i think shown here)
