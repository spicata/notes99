- 3 charge states (not types of charge):
    - ve+ : proton, positron, cation
    - ve- : electron, anion
    - neutral (no charge) : neutron, neutrino, antineutrino
    - neutral (equal charge) : H2O, atom
- Anything with a net charge will produce an electric field around it
    - a field is a region of space
    - electric field is a field which extends to infinity. any other charged object will experience a repulsive/attractive force which decreases respect to distance (inverse square law)
- Field-diagram-line rules:
    1. they are arrows (middle, not end)
    2. arrows go away from the +ve, towards -ve
    3. straight lines (except when not)
    4. evenly distributed around point-charge
    5. min of 4 lines of recommended (3 is min)
    6. line connected to the surface of the point-particle
    7. field lines never cross (or touch)
