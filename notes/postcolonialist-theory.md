Edward Said: the "oriental" is not a thing that truly exists. It is a concept manufactured — whether intentionally or not — by Europeans in order to juxtapose the 'superior' Western culture to a straw-man of Eastern culture (supposedly cruel, evil, cunning, etc), in order to justify any acts against them.

Cultural colonisation is the instilling of European values and thought within different cultures. Led to the creation of colonial subjects, who believed in the superiority of coloniser culture, leading to mimicry. Such belief is called double consciousness/vision: the perceiving of the world through two very different lenses. Heightened by diaspora, creating unhomeliness: feeling not at home at home.

Colonialist discourse/ideology encompasses the beliefs held by early European colonisers, example:
- Self vs Other
- Othering: exotic and demonic other
- Oriental
- Eurocentrism
- First, second, third, fourth worlds NB: fourth are the minoirty Indigenous peoples

> The use of English solidifies cultural colonisation, but is it a worthy sacrifice for being able to communicate with more?
