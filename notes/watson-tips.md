The syntax structue is not regular, sometimes going on for more than one line, sometimes note. Diction is not formal, but also not informal, probably something like colloquilisms, sometimes Indigenous jargon. 

War poetry is oft very structured, but as it moves further and further on in time (e.g. Vietnam war, 911, so on) structure becomes more free verse. Possibly as a result from:
- Questioning of the subject matter e.g. What am I doing here?
- Could it also be something like not abiding by limitations set?

Focus on figurative language is more important in Watson's poems, due to the lack of structure.
