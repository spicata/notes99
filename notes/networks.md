## networks

- connectors (connie) are people who know lots and lots of people, they are human directories. they know lots of people from lots of different fields.
    - a 'linker'. it is their friend group, not yours
    - friend paradox
- mavens are people who are specialists in their field. when they discover something, they spread it.
    - different from Machiavelli, as mavens are sincere and they want to help people istead, rather than puttin gtheir own need first
    - they help themselves by helping others; the help others by helping themselves
    - not antisocial, rather, like connectors, they are also sociable and they share information like that
- salesmen are people who are able to effectively 'sell' an idea to other people.
    - possible because of a natural exuberance
    - even without speaking, they are able to spread their feelings (maybe like the mirror neurons)
- innovators are the people who create new ideas. they are the first adopters, however, the majority lags behind them. the above 3 act as translators, making it easier for the majority to accept it.

## context

- the environment around a person is what shapes them. the little things specifically
