> Journal is a written record of incidents, experiences, and ideas.

Journals are essentially a documentation of what you've done. And also, it's a revision tool. So, what should you put in a journal?

- notes
- vocabulary, definitions, and terminology
- **personal** insights, ideas, understandings, responses
- compiled research (with citations)
- planning and drafting
- diagrams and mind-maps
- timed writing exercises
- quote banks

It needs to be physical though. But don't include things that aren't yours. Or anything too personal.

NB: Colours are your friends.

Please almighty soup company don't screw us please dear god.
