When something HOTter touches something COLDer, then there is a net transfer of heat from HOT to COLD.

```
          ----> (heat transfer)

|    HOT   | |   COLD   |

Also:
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| (Kelvin)

```

This is determined by thermal conductivity: ability of a substance to transfer heat energy within its structure. Free (delocalised) electrons can pick-up, carry, and deposit thermal energy well. Like electricity. 

Thermal expansion: objects will get larger as they heat up. Because all the particles oscillate/vibrate more and so the spaces between each particle will expand.

Heat is transferred by (1) conduction: when 2 objects in contact transfer heat through surfaces (2) convection: part of a substance viz. liquids and gases; have portions of different heat, hence becomes less dense and moves with respect to the rest (3) radiation: transfer of heat by EMR radiation.

Thermal equilibrium is when they are at the same temperature HENCE there is no net transfer of heat. Two objects of different temperature will transfer heat from one to another (see above).
