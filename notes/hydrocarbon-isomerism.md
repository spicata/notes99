- structural isomerism (i.e. structure is different viz. chain, positional, functional group) vs stereoisomerism (i.e. 3d geometry different viz. geometric, optical)
    - chain isomers are arranged differently
    - positional isomers → functional group/bond in different carbon atom
    - functional group have different functional groups (e.g. alcohol and ether)
    - cis-trans isomerism (alkenes)
        - Entgegen-Zusammen notation (opposite-same notation)
        - first bond → sigma bond :: second bond → pi bond (see diagram); this prevents it from rotating
    - optical isomers are mirror images of each other.
