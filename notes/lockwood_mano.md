*Some (class-wide) notes and planning on "The Animals of Lockwood Manor"*

Class is not just money. Higher classes owns the means of production (land). This leads to the class distinctions, of social status/rank, tradition/family, taste, and education. People can be rich (you win a lottery), but you don't have land and property.

Character: 1st person narrator, probably young, probably wealthy (upper-class), anxious, probably female, Untitled.

Why female? (1) All of the other characters references are female viz. grandmother, mother, governess. (2) It is a Gothic text, hence the archetype of Gothic heroine. (3) Also, they are confined to the house. (I guessed wrong, lol)

Setting: Lockwood Manor (important!!!), creepy, in need of repair, empty, old.

It could be a homage to the Gothic genre, especially *Jane Eyre*. Or mental illness. Or pandemic/isolation. Or uncanny (unheimlich) (familiar becomes unfamiliar) (liminal space). Or **THE** house. Or class or Marxist. Or gendered reading (women stuck in domestic spaces). Or WWII.
