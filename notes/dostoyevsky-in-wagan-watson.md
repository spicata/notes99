This death of identity and culture is evident in the "retirement eternal for the dreamtime Dostoyevsky"; the Dostoyevsky — or as seen throughout the rest of the texts, 'Dostoyevskys' — acts as a synecdoche of those who are connected to Indigenous culture and spirituality. Also, their retirement eternal is a euphemism for death, and so this quote is representative of the death of those people who are most intimately connected to Indigenous culture. Dostoyevsky is also commonly seen as a voice for the silent and marginalised as his texts would often depict the struggles and hardships of normal people during times of economic, social, and political tumult. Of similar interest would be the lack of capitalisation in the word Dreamtime: a proper noun. This lack of punctuation could be interpreted as a reflection of the devaluation of Indigenous spirituality — and by extension — Indigenous spiritual identity within Western society. This is placed in harsh contrast with "the Covenant", a Christian concept brought by European colonisers. The capitalisation here works to contrast the lack of capitalisation in dreamtime, reflecting the ways that western culture is placed above indigenous culture. On a similar note, the lack of capitalised can be read as the Dreamtime having been the original norm of Australia, and represents western culture as an intrusion into the original Australian experience.​
