## Question 2a

> Using the graph, estimate the half-life of the carbon-14 isotopes.

Ranges between 5 400 to 5 900 years.

---

## Question 3

> Describe how the RCD operates. Include in your answer what would cause the switch to be in the OFF position and how some lights in the house are still able to operate normally.

An RCD compares the current in the live and the neutral wire. They should be the same. When they are different, the RCD breaks the power supply. Household circuits are connected in parallel. Different RCDs control different parallel branches so that lights on different branches still work properly.

## Question 5a

> Identiy the particles labeled A and B by stating their symbol, mass number and atomic number.

| Particle | Symbol | Mass # | Atomic # |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| A        | Cs     | 137    | 55       |
| B        | Rb     | 90     | 37       |

## Question 6b

> State one significant source of error in the student's method and what effect it would have on the calculated value of the specific heat capacity.

Heat lost by metal during transfer. The SHC is lower.

OR

Water may evaporate. The SHC is lower.

OR

There may be air in the tub. The SHC is lower.

## Question 7

> Sound waves can travel through any medium containing particles. As they travel through the medium, the particles are disturbed from their rest position temporarily. Name and define two ways in which sound waves can be classified with reference to the statement.

They are longitudinal. Particles moves parallel to the wave direction. They are also mechanical. They need a particle-based medium to transfer the energy.

---

## Question 8b

> State the name of the observed wave behaviour as the wave passes through the gap.

Diffraction. Not defraction.

---

## Question 8c

> State and describe the type of behaviour that is observed as the reflected waves meet the incident waves.

Interference. In constructive interference, the wave amplitude becomes larger as two peaks interfere. In destructive interference, the wave amplitude becomes smaller as a peak and trough interfere.

---

## Question 12b

> Explain what is meant by a nucleus being unstable and therefore starts to decay. Include in your answer, an explanation for the trend that is shown by the 'line of stability'.

Nucleus contains electrostatic repulsion and strong nuclear force attraction between protons. As nucleus large, the electrostatic attraction becomes larger relative to the strong nuclear attraction. This makes the nucleus unstable. More neutrons are needed to shield protons from the repulsive forces. Hence, the line of stability gradient increases as number of neutron is greater than number of protons.

## Question 13a

> Explain the function of the fuse in the circuit.

If a short circuit occurs, it would cause an overload of current. The fuse melts and thereby breaks the circuit, protecting the devices.

---

## Question 13f

> If one of the light bulbs failed, explain how the total current in the circuit would be affected.

If one of the bulbs fail, the resistance of that parallel branch increases, and therefor the resistance of the circuit increases. Voltage stays the same. The current decreases.

---

## Question 14d

I don't know what went wrong here.

---

## Question 15a

> Calculate the speed of Ball 1 as it reaches point A

Write the velocity.

---

## Queston 16a

> Complete the missing values in the table above. The values for the 250 g mass has been completed for you. You may use the space below for you working.

| Mass | Normal F | Trail 1 | Trail 2 | Trail 3 | Trail 4 | Average F |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| ...  | ...      | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...       |
| 450  | 4.41     | 0.30    | 0.29    | 0.28    | 0.30    | 0.29      |

## Question 16e

> Use your graph to calculate the gradient of your line of best fit.

Estimation are 2 s.f.

---

## Question 17a

> Explain, referencing the kinetic theory why the heated gas can cause the piston to move.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles of a substance. When the gas is heated, the aver kinetic energy of the particles increases. The particles collide with a greater force with each other and push each other apart. This causes an unbalanced force which moves the piston outwards.

---

## Question 17b

> As the 200 g is heated, it experience a temperature increase of 30.0'C. Calculate the amount of heat energy added to the gas.

It was kilojoules. Not just joules
