Some quick trends: Boiling point and atomic radius increases downwards. Electronegativity decreases downwards. They are insoluble in water.

And also, we don't talk about astatine.

## reactions

Halogens react with metals to form a metal halide.

| Element | With H                                                 | With Fe wool             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Cl      | Explodes in bright sunlight. Reacts slowly in the dark | Burns and glows brightly |
| Br      | Reacts slowly with platinum catalyst                   | Glows, but not brightly  |
| I       | Reacts partially, and very slowly at that              | Very slightly glows      |

A more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halogen. It does this by taking electrons. This means that the more reactive halogen is always reduced. The less reactive halogen is always oxidised. e.g.

$$Cl_{2}+2KI\to 2KCl+I_{2}$$

$$Cl_{2}+H_{2}O\to HCl+HOCl$$

The latter is a disproportionation reaction (see [redox](redox)).

NB: The more reactive halogen want to become an ion. This is because this will give it a full valence electron shell.

## halides

Halides are anything containing a halogen. 

Something about [metal reactivity](metal_reactivity.md).

## in action

[a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC8kEpWMSkk)

Halogens will prefer to be dissolved in cyclohexane rather than water. When the chlorine water and KBr was mixed, it produced an orange layer and a pale yellow layer. When the chlorine 

| Solution        | KCl                       | KBr                     | KI                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Chlorine water  | -                         | Orange over pale yellow | Purple over orange-yellow | 
| Bromine water   | Orange over pale yellow   | -                       | Purple over red           |
| Iodide solution | Purple over orange-yellow | Purple over red         | -                         |

They are genuinely the same colour, but people are saying otherwise.
