*The Feminine Mystique*: a book by Betty Friedan, 1963.

This book sparked the second wave of feminism.

The book explores "the problem with no name", that is, the unhappiness of women in traditional roles, such as of a housewife or a mother. The presumption that women would be happy with these roles is what is called the "feminine mystique". This coincided with a growing number of women that would drop out of education so that they could marry earlier ([how ironic](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/)).

Media, as controlled by men, also propagated this myth of a happy housewife vs an unhappy careerist. 

Whereas early feminists (first wave), fought for important rights, this work looks at the social aspect. 

Critiqued for not including experiences of black and lesbian women. Black women already had to get careers for money.
