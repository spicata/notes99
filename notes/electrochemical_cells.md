There are two types of electrochemical cells: galvanic cells, which onvert chemical potential energy to electrical energy; and electrolytic cells, which convert electrical energy to chemical potential energy.

## galvanic cells

> [!todo] JUST ADD DIAGRAMS

Galvanic cells are made up of...

- electrodes
- electrolyte solutions
- a salt bridge
- a voltmeter

Anode and cathode are electrons. Anodes is where oxidation happens (losing electrons → becoming positive), and cathodes is where reduction happens (gaining electrons → becoming negative).

Electrolyte solutions contains the dissolved things.

A salt bridge contains ions. When there is a difference in charge, the salt bridge releases cations and anions to balance the charge. e.g. KCl, KNO3

When a rod of metal is dipped into a solution of its won ions, it is in an equilibrium.

Anions move towards the anode, and the cations move towards the cathode.
