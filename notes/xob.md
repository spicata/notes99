## story

green mostly keeps a low profile at the start, but that changes when he is reminded of (the now deceased) flame's birthday. knowing that blue is sure to be there, he goes over to her grave.

> how poetic, the lovebirds meet again

after shooting blue, he returns to the town.

general idea: everyone has different side-stories and arcs, all of them eventually leading to the final act (the showdown), where green gains control of the scarlet arm, and becomes a tyrant

---

Green will be motivated only by the pursuit of power — thinking that power is the ultimate freedom — and will happily lie, murder, and frame to achieve this goal. He carries no regrets nor burdens, oftentimes switching between an efficient and cold murderer or a maniacal puppet master of sorts.

- Green visits Flame's tombstone, knowing he'll meet Blue there, to 'tie up some loose ends'. He'll then frame Red for this, leading to Red's imprisonment. Red has no alibi, as he was out in the vast expanse of the desert looking for ancient power cells, a task that Green set him on.
- Green hires mercenaries in order to attack the townies, distracting them and giving them an enemy to accuse; effectively drawing their attention away from him. These mercenaries act as the primary antagonist of the first few acts.
- Green equips the mercenaries with tools that would let them circumvent the powers of the scarlet arm, making Navy's powers useless against them, as a means to gain the scarlet arm in an act of final desperation.
- Tortures Cyan.
- Blood Tyrant Green
- Fighting until the very end

In this series, Blue will be a much more minor character, rather serving simply as a catalyst for change. Having now left the town, he has regrets about leaving his comrades, and yet he enjoys his retirement (finally free); his scarlet arm served more as a restraint then anything freeing. He continues to go around and help others.

- Gets... shot
- Comes back in the final act. Seen in the void, he encourages his fellow townmates to strive on, to finish the battle, even against the adversity they face.
- Shown in the post-final-act as being reunited with Flame.

Pink will be our major 'protagonist' of sorts, being a voice of reason. Since Blue's retirement and voluntary exile, Pink and Red go on a search for him, to no avail.

- Saddened by the leaving of Blue, Pink becomes more and more obsessed of the search for Blue, to the extent where her mental and physical health start to become impacted adversely. Red will recommend her to take a break from this whole mess, and that he will take care of it himself.
- After coming back to see Red being imprisoned for the murder of Blue, she loses her faith in Red, and this event severely damages her trust and forgiveness in others. Actions of support are twisted into actions of harm within her mind, and she (kind of) loses it.
- She spends time on the bench at the edge, watching sunsets, contemplating.
- From a tip off from Cyan that Red may not be true cause of Blue's death, she goes on to investigate even more on the person who killed Blue. After time passes, she learns that more and more of the evidence points (in truth) to Green being the killer.
- The final act begins.
    - Going off of the 'revenge bad' trope, Pink has to come to terms with the actions that she took in order to take revenge on Green, and has a moment of weakness, where she questions if this was truly the correct thing to do. Taking advantage of this weakness, Green takes Pink's life.
