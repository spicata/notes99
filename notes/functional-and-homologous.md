Hydroxyl functional group (as in alcohol).

![functional-groups](assets/functional-groups.png)

Functional groups are atoms or groups of atoms that gives a molecule its chemical properties, such as the -OH in the alcohol. Any substituents (branches) e.g. methyl, are also functional groups.

Functional groups is to chemical what carbon chain length is to physical.

![homologous-series](assets/homologous-series.png)

Homologous series are groups of molecules with the same function group but a different carbon chain length, e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, etc.

- functional group → an atom or group of atoms responsible for the typical chemical reactions of a molecule tldr gives it it's chemical properties e.g. OH in alcohol
    - functional groups: chemical
    - carbon chain length: physcial
- homologous series → group of molecs with same functional group but different CH2 groups.
