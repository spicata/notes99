- Coulomb's law:
- $F_{e}=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}$
    - Fe → electric force between 2 charged particles (N)
    - q1 → charge on particle (C oulomb) (C is very big)
    - q2 → charge on particle 2
    - r → distance between the particles (m)
    - k → N m^2 c^-2 (the A rchie)
        - in air/vacuum → 9.00e+9 N m^2 c^-2
