Imaginary numbers are imaginary (because I said so).

We watched the Oscar winning feature film "The Life of i", also known as "The Struggle ~~is~~ to be Real".

$$i=\sqrt{ -1 }$$

Now I can do things like 3i or -1.5i. These are called imaginary (bi, where b is real). Imaginary numbers are actually numbers, although they can't be expressed more simply. When you add a real number and an imaginary number, you get a complex number. 

When z=a+bi, a=Re(z), b=Im(z).
