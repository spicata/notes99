HCl is not an ionic substance. It is molecular. This should have been a dead giveaway for the Arrhenius model. (1)

A substance usually has the colour of any coloured ions that make it up. I read that for nickel, and proceeded to choose grey. (1)

CH3COO IS WEAK (1). It doesn't fully ionise.

Be more careful. (enthalpy) (1)

Had to explain in reference to the diagram, specifically the shape and gradient. (1) Also, it increases the frequency of successful collisions. (1)

Pressure and volume is inversely proportional. This means it is curved. (1)

For the balloon in the fridge, should've specified that the force of collisions would have decreased due to decreasing kinetic energy. (1)

Listen to Pranav next time (2).
