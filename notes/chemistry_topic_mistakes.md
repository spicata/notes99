HCl is not an ionic substance. It is molecular. This should have been a dead giveaway for the Arrhenius model. (1)

A substance usually has the colour of any coloured ions that make it up. I read that for nickel, and proceeded to choose grey. (1)

CH3COO IS WEAK (1). It doesn't fully ionise.

Be more careful. (enthalpy) (1)

Pressure and volume is inversely proportional. This means it is curved. (1)
