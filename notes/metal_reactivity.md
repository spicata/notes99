If two metals have a similar reactivity, they will not react. On the other hand, if they have different reactivities, then they will react. From most reactive to least reactive:

```
K    ^ (Most reactive)
Na   |
Ca   |
Mg   |
Al   |
Zn   |
Fe   |
Pb   |
H    |
Cu   |
Hg   |
Ag   |
Au   v (Least reactive)
```
