*The Remains of the Day* (1989) by English author Kazuo Ishiguro is a novel depicting a butler — Stevens — who goes on a holiday with the allowance of his master, with this extract detailing his initial response to leaving his house and going into the wilderness. By reading this text with specific focus on the use of narrative devices, one can understand the impact that sudden change has on the lives of individuals.

Settings tend to play a major role in directing the plot and informing readers, and so the gradual change in setting throughout this extract can be deemed significant in reflecting the inner trials and tribulations of Stevens, the protagonist. At the start of this extract, the protagonist recognises that, despite having "motored further and further from the house", he still found himself "in surroundings with which I had at least a passing acquaintance." The house can be seen as a place of comfort, especially alongside the connotations of one's home as something that is deeply personal and comfortable to an individual. In this sense, the lack — or rather the moving away from — a place of residence, is understood as an individual delving into an unknown, seemingly conflicting with the ideas of holidays being an opportunity to unload. There is then the gradual transition to a more wild and untamed setting, one that is covered in "trees and thick foliage", and a trail that looks "steep and rather rough". With this, it becomes evident that this natural setting works to mirror the inner plight of the character, the rough road acting as a metaphor of the figurative rough road that is ahead of him. It was only due to a change — the holiday — that he was brought to this location: a crossroads of sorts. This change in setting represents change itself, as something that transports individuals from where they are now — a comfortable safe-space — to a more arduous and tough path, but one that (in the words of the old man), "you'll be sorry of you don't take a walk up there".

Characters also act as vessels for the reader to empathise with, and their characterisations indicate to the significance of events around them. Despite going on a so-called holiday, Stevens is not "seized by any excitement or anticipation at all", rather believing that "[he]'d rather stay here." Firstly, the use of the first-person point of view cements the reader's connection to the character, especially through the use of a more personal internal monologue. This sets up the character as one that the audience can relate to. Then, his actions and words to the old man (the only other character in the extract) display a sense of hesitance in taking this holiday — in taking some time for himself and experiencing a change in his life — rather wishing to just 'stay here'. This is despite the fact that the taking 'the harder road', in this case: change, would allow him to experience the best views in all of London, allegorical of the ways that leaving one's comfort zone allows individuals to live life more fully. Through Stevens characterisation, his want to take the easier and more familiar road is put into direct conflict with his want to also take the road that, despite the difficulty, would allow him to living more fully; this sets up an internal conflict, one which is able to resonate more deeply due to the first-person point of view. In doing this, this change can be read as an invitation to the reader to live more fully; to leave one's own comfort zone despite how dreadful it may be.
