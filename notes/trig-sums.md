If we get y=2sinx and y=3sinx, then add them, what will the end graph look like?

=> see also, constructive and destructive interference

What does sinx + cosx look like? Like this!

$$\sqrt{ 2 }\sin \left( x+\frac{\pi}{4} \right)$$

Well how about asinx + bcosx? Well...

$$\begin{align}
a\sin x+b\cos x&=\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 }\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 }} \sin x+\frac{b}{\sqrt{ a^2+b^2 }}\cos x\right)
\end{align}$$

Which can guarantee that there will be a solution because of pythagoras.
