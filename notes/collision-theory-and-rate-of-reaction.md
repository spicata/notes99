title: collision theory and rate of reaction

Collision theory: reactions occur when reactants collide with sufficient energy with the correct orientation. The more successful reactions in a period of time, the faster the rate of reaction.

=> see: [enthalpy](/notes/enthalpy)

$$\text{rate of reaction}=\frac{\text{no. successful reaction}}{\Delta t}$$

To measure rate of reaction, you need a proxy (e.g. mass, colour, volume, etc i.e. change of mass over time). This rate will slow down as the progress of reaction. This is because there are less reactants (but more products) left, meaning that the chance reactions will become less and less likely

=> see: Maxwell Boltzmann Distribution

Rate of reactions are dependent on the (1) frequency of collisions (successful or not) or (2) proportion of successful collisions. Example:
- Temperature (1)(2) - increases kinetic energy for both (1) and (2)
- Concentration of dissolved reactants (1) - more particles increases chance collisions
- Volume/pressure (1) NB: pressure is caused by a lower volume, but does not directly cause the change in rate of reaction
- Surface area (1) - larger area to collide with
- Catalysts (2) - these are substances that change the rate of a reaction without being used up in the reaction by offering an alternative pathway (has a lower activation energy)

Temperature will stretch the Maxwell-Boltzmann curve right and down. Catalysts will move the activation energy on the curve.
