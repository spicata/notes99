      <ul>
  <li>Short chain alkanes will undergo complete combustion in excess oxygen.</li>
  <li>It is very exothermic, and so is favourable for use as fuels</li>
  <li>It will produce carbon dioxide and water</li>
  <li>However, in incomplete combustion <span class="small-date">(not enough O2)</span class="small-date">, it will produce monoxide or carbon <span class="small-date">(soot)</span class="small-date">. Less energy produBiocing.</li>
  <li>Tends to use pent- to decane in internal combustion engines <span class="small-date">(i.e. car engines)</span class="small-date">; will not always be complete</li>
  <li>Burning fuels will release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This will add to the greenhouse effect.</li>
  <li>GHG absorb infrared energy, which causes molecules to vibrate. These will the re-emit them in all directions or transfer them to other particles creating kinetic energy.</li>
  <li>How do we fight this? Carbon neutral means that no new CO2 is produced. You can do this by…</li>
  <li>Reduce carbon emissions</li>
  <li>Offset carbon emissions — absorb carbon emission released e.g. Mr Beast Team Trees</li>
  <li>Biofuels <span class="small-date">(viz. bioethanol and biodiesel)</span class="small-date"> are renewable fuels from plant material</li>
  <li>Costs are similar, and the by-products can also be used for production</li>
  <li>Production itself also requires energy, and so will produce CO2</li>
  <li>Few produces means that there are only small quantities. It also has high demand for land, and so it would require some deforestation.</li>
  <li>When calculating the emperical formula, the steps are mass &gt; moles &gt; mole ratio &gt; simplest mole ratio &gt; empirical formula</li>
  <li>You can calculate molecular formula from empirical formula if you are also given the relative mass; by dividing Mr by Mef.</li>
  <li>molar volume at STP for gas = 22.71 L</li>
  <li>Combustion analysis: …</li>
