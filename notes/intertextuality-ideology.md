Intertextuality is when a text is connected to another (I guess). For example:
- When there are recurring symbols (e.g. stucco and the black dingo)
- Similar themes
- Parody, mimicry, and pastiche
- Allusions (e.g.in *the dingo lounge* when Morpheus)

> Ideologies are a system of attitudes, values, and beliefs
