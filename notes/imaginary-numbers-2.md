For + and - just treat imaginary numbers as variables. But not for \* and /. :-D

$$\bar{z}=z^{*}=a-bi\text{ is the complex conjugate of }z=a+bi$$
$$|z|=\sqrt{ a^2+b^{2} }\text{ is the modulus of }z=a+bi$$

Multiplication of imaginary numbers is almost just like normal variables. But, i^(even number)=-1.

$$z+\bar{z}=2Re(z)\text{ and }z\bar{z}=Re(z)^{2}+Im(z)^{2}=|z|^{2}$$

Always real numbers!
