        <h1>Charles' Law</h1>
      
      <p>When the temperature increases, each particle will have more kinetic energy, thus colliding will more walls and other particles, which increases the pressure. However, at a constant pressure, this will instead result in the volume increasing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Charlesâ€™ Law: at constant pressure, the volume of a fixed quantity of gas is proportional to its absolute temperature</li>
  <li>V1/T1 = V2/T2. Temperature must be in Kelvin</li>
</ul>
