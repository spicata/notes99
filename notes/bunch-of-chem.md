- Short chain alkanes will undergo complete combustion in excess oxygen.
- It is very exothermic, and so is favourable for use as fuels
- It will produce carbon dioxide and water
- However, in incomplete combustion (not enough O2), it will produce monoxide or carbon (soot). Less energy produBiocing.
- Tends to use pent- to decane in internal combustion engines (i.e. car engines); will not always be complete
+ Burning fuels will release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This will add to the greenhouse effect.
+ GHG absorb infrared energy, which causes molecules to vibrate. These will the re-emit them in all directions or transfer them to other particles creating kinetic energy.
- How do we fight this? Carbon neutral means that no new CO2 is produced. You can do this by...
- Reduce carbon emissions
- Offset carbon emissions â€” absorb carbon emission released e.g. Mr Beast Team Trees
+ Biofuels (viz. bioethanol and biodiesel) are renewable fuels from plant material
+ Costs are similar, and the by-products can also be used for production
+ Production itself also requires energy, and so will produce CO2
+ Few produces means that there are only small quantities. It also has high demand for land, and so it would require some deforestation.
- When calculating the emperical formula, the steps are mass > moles > mole ratio > simplest mole ratio > empirical formula
- You can calculate molecular formula from empirical formula if you are also given the relative mass; by dividing Mr by Mef.
+ molar volume at STP for gas = 22.71 L
