## techniques, devices, and meaning

- "the dreamtime Dostoyevskys": lack of punctuation in the dreamtime, which is a proper noun that is usually capitalised, could reveal that this is the 'norm', having become normalised within the Indigenous Australian society. Contrast this with "something called the Covenant", a biblical contract brought by colonisers. The capitalisation here juxtaposes it to dreamtime, showing its foreign nature.
    - On the other hand, this could be interpreted as the devaluation of Indigenous culture, instead reflecting the overly dominant importance of 'the Covenant' in modern society; this acts as a synecdoche of Christianity, and by extension, Western society and culture as a whole.
- "the white man didn't bring all the evil / ... gestating ... / ... untapped": lexical chain of words like 'gestating' and 'untapped' shows that some of them had the capability to cause evil, however, this laid dormant until activated by the Western colonisation.
    - Can be reinforced by "payback time for the bureaucrats in black skins / and the fratricide troopers": connotations of bureaucrats (Western, untrustworthy, conniving) and fratricide (betrayal, Cain-like), asking for retribution against fellow Indigenous peoples who betrayed them and ratted them out.
- "the dreamtime Dostoyevskys" x3 ... "the dreamtime Dostoyevsky": this line is a motif that runs throughout the entire text. Disregarding Dostoyevsky's context (because I'm not responsible for that), 'dreamtime Dostoyevskys' is a reference to a group and/or community of people that are still connected to Indigenous spirituality and culture as a whole. Notice the plural, which refers to at least two people. However, this changes by the end of the poem, the final line talking about the permanent retirement of "the dreamtime Dostoyevsky", which is singular. Could be an indication of the death of the final dreamtime Dostoyevsky, bringing their age to an end, as people begin to forget about their very own culture.
    - Dostoyevsky will probably bring some more significance to this idea.
    - For a little bit of context, it is claimed that Dostoyevsky wrote mainly about spiritual, political, and economic **struggles and turmoils**, particularly in 19th-century Russia. Do with that information what you will.
