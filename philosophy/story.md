I don't intend on being a hero. Nor do I intend on being a villain. These terms don't say much. Instead, I'm just gonna make a story that people will remember.

If that means I need to be a hero or villain, so be it. But those are not my goals. The goal is giving people something to remember. A story that can be told.
