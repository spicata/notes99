There are times that I had enjoyed, and friends that I had made. Journeys that I wish that I could replay. A longing reminiscence, and it is only too late that I wish that I had noted it down, and so they are lost. Fuzzy memories, and incomplete stories.

And it is then, when I reminisce, that I am filled with a pang of bittersweet. I am sad that this time has passed, that the friends I have enjoyed my time with have drifted away, that the stories that seemed to warp my life around it has become a mere speck, far away. Long gone. 

And yet I am filled with a deep gratitude, that I was able to enjoy such a time, and that I can long for it now. I am glad that I am able to think of my friends in such a way. I am thankful for what I have experienced thus far. And I wish I could have been better to those around me that I no longer have the liberty to spend my time around. I was not the best to them, and I really hope that I been more. But what's passed has passed, and I am just happy that they were by me when everything happened.
