Overwhelmed, lacking confidence, and confused. This is what I feel when I do something I simply cannot fathom, something I cannot understand. I feel unable to start anything, because I am overwhelmed by the density of the thicket that stands in front of me, I simply do not know where to start to hack. Every way looks like an impenetrable forest, and so I don't know which way to go.

I know that the only way to proceed would be to journey into the jungle, but I cannot bring myself to do it. I no longer possess the blind confidence in myself than I had when I thought I was able to do it. Instead I feel this festering fear within my soul, only reinforced by how I have done so far (not well). And so, I am unable to go into the forest, forever trapped in this little island that I seem alone in. Forever puzzled, unable to ever comprehend the challenges that I am faced with.

Yeah... I have no clue what I am doing. I just hope that someone can show me the path, but I do not know who to ask. And I am afraid, that too.

sigh. what am i doing anymore? i have no clue anymore. im terrified. and i feel sick on the inside too.
