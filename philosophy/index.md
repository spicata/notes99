Little things that I will write to explain how I work, my 'philosophy'. All contradictory, all confusing, together showing what kind of a person I am.

Hopefully if you know me, you can get to know me better, and if you don't, then you do. And at the end of it all, I hope that you take something away.

Oh yeah, also. There is one person that I want specifically to read this, because if you read it (and that person will know who they are), you will understand where I am coming from, and you might also understand the advice I am trying to give you, and hopefully you won't dismiss said advice by saying something like "I don't have time rn", or "I'm busy", you fricking donkey.
