## Quick Explanation

A Static Site Generator --- also known more commonly as an SSG --- is something that helps you make a static site. It takes the content that you have written, and the template HTML that you (or somebody else) has written, and compiles all of it into a neat little website for of it.

But what is a static site? A static site is a website that does to require a backend; there are no servers that need to process any data for you website, it just works on its own (on the user's computer).

### Analogy

You have a machine that makes sandwiches. However, you need to put in the jam or peanut butter or whatever else you want to put into it. Then, it gets those ingredients, then follows the specific recipe it was provided (in this case, put all of the innards between two slices of bread), and then ejects a full sandwich.

## Types

There are many different SSGs that you can use; the most famous of them include: Jekyll, Hugo, Next.js, and Zola. You can find more at [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/).

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the oldest of the modern SSGs. It is written in Ruby.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is another SSG coded in Go. It is faster, but also has more complicated syntax.

These two are the two big ones used in the town, and I don't have much experience with the other ones, so I am not qualified to write about them.
