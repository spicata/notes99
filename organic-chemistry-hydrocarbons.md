- organic compounds is based on carbon atoms, usually contains hydrogen too
- covalent bonds between the carbon atoms, hence typical covalent properties e.g.
    - low melting points
    - low boiling points
    - soluble in non-polar solvent
    - insoluble in water (think of oil)
    - soft and malleable
- other properties include
    - highly flammable

## alkanes

- alkanes are saturated AKA can't make more bonds
- structural isomers (substances with same number + type of elements but different structure): pentane, methylbutane, dimethylpropane
- branches are called substituents
- alkanes only have two reactions: combustion and substitution
    - combustion produces water, CO2, and heat. fire to a gas station ðŸ’¥
    - subsitution: hydrogen replaced with an element; viz. Cl or Br. Needs sufficient energy e.g. UV light
    
        $CH_{4}+Cl_{2(g)}\to CH_{3}Cl_{(g)}+HCl_{(g)}$
    - Can continue until literally can't, eg tetrachloromethane (CCl4)

## alkenes

- Alkenes have at least 1 pair of carbon double bond (unsaturated) (e.g. but-1,2-diene)
- but-1-ene, but-2-ene are both **positional** isomers
- first bond â†’ sigma bond :: second bond â†’ pi bond (see diagram); this prevents it from rotating
- double bonds make alkenes very reactive:
    - combustion 
    - addition: double bond is snapped and the an element is added e.g. halogens (Br Br), water (H OH)
        it can have options if asymetrical, eg propene + HBr
    - polymerisation: ethene can react with itself to create long chains
- benzene is aromatic hydrocarbon (strong armo)
    - benzene has 'semi-single-double' bonds (creates cloud of delocal electrons above and below ring).
    - stable
    - reactions are substitutions, eg alkylation (add alkyl group), halogenation, nitration
- cyclohexene -w/ substituents â†’ no need for number

## alkynes

- alkynes have triple bonds, cycloalkynes are unstable
