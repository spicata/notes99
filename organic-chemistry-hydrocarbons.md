- organic compounds is based on carbon atoms, usually contains hydrogen too
- covalent bonds between the carbon atoms, hence typical covalent properties e.g.
    - low melting points
    - low boiling points
- other properties include
    - highly flammable
    - soluble in non-polar solvent
    - insoluble in water (think of oil)
- alkanes are saturated AKA can't make more bonds
- structural isomers (substances with same number + type of elements but different structure): pentane, methylbutane, dimethylpropane
- branches are called substituents
