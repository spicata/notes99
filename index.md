hi! i'm **m.spicata**, and i own this "shop". i don't sell anything here, but instead i give away **stuff for free**. if you think it's worth it take it; if you don't want it, leave it.

outside, i grow my [mint fresh notes](https://spicata.github.io/mint-fresh-notes/), and upstairs, i dream of a [betternet](https://spicata.github.io/betternet/). you can also visit my [neighbour edward](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2/) (he's always hard at work). on the other side of the road, you'll see [notmario](https://notes.notmario.net/) and [mace](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/). of course, you could also just stick around here, listen to what i have to say.

in order to counterbalance the jzhao of my website: ඞඔඕඖචඣඩඬඹ.
