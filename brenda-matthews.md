- Metthews was taken away shortly after the stealing of children was illegalised, so she is not technically or officially considered a part of the Stolen Generation
- Watch the last daughter
- Brenda is not white, but also does not ight into the other 'blackfellows' (because she was taken away)
- The Government took Brenda and her 6 other siblings; no goodbyes. Why? Because apparently they were neglected â†’ causes a lot of emotional hurt
