Did you know that the Plains of Infinite Knowledge looks different for everyone? That was just an interesting thing that I noticed throughout my travels, I think. It also changes based on how you feel and how you think. I guess it just depends really on how you look at it. Different people see different things, some things stick out to them, and they all forge different paths. Oh yeah, you can also meet the Mentors there; they are experts in navigating the Plains, but in their own particular way, you just kind of have to trust them and go along. Your journey ends up literally being defined by who you meet. Of course, if you think you can take it on yourself, sure. Good luck!

Of course though, there are always different ways of getting the information stored there. You can always visit the superhighways of the city, some are really quick, and some like to take a rather scenic route. It's a wonderful place, a thriving metropolis of an insane wealth of knowledge. It is incredible how much stuff they are able to siphon from the plains. But I fear them, because of their restricted trading partners and their almost slavish agreements, as well as their audacity to find loopholes to keep your time, money, and data. It's simply not my style.

So that's why I made this town. I cam here, to the desert scrap that we are all condemned to, plagued by twisters and sandstorms, and built a small house. That house, sadly does not exist, for I have demolished it, but the complex you find yourself in is built on the very foundations of that old home, albeit it with a little bit more concrete and a cellar. This ground floor is usually where I stay, and you can listen to me ramble and rant. But I'm sure you are busy; you want the information that I have got from the plains. Luckily for you, i house a greenhouse on the 1st level. Some of the Plants of Wisdom are cultivated there. You might also be able to find my map around there. Above that is for people who want some fun, my very own comic strip! It's called xob, pronounced zob, and currently it has a little bit of a story going on. I always have an open door policy, so feel free to come in any time, it will always be free of charge.

[Of course, along the way, I pestered Edward about having no house, so much so that he decided to settle down right next to mine](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/). Now, he's the second oldest member of the town and also the mayor. He's a great chemist, he always has entertaining things to say, and his pasta is ... okay. Also, if you come into the town and notice that his house is missing, it's probably cause he's burnt it down again.

Legend speaks of two other members of the town who have been here since near the start. That is true, and I know it because I was there. Before the town, we had a slightly less organised organisation with a similar concept to the Town called the 'Notes Coalition'.

Excluding Edward and I, there were two other members of this coalition, [the first of which was notmario. His notes are still updated](https://notmario.github.io/thenotes/). He's a talented programmer, and he's quite punctual too, creating lots of different projects. He is the person responsible for quite a large chunk of the town's public infrastructure.

The other once was Mace. He's moved out, [but his shell of a house still stands](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/). These two are our two first generation immigrants. There was also two more people who attempted to join the Notes Coalition, but wasn't able to due to the imminent death of it. These people were Anonymous and Reaper.

[Anonymous has finally set up his house very recently](https://anonymoof1528.github.io/into-the-shadow-garten/). It used to exist earlier, but he fell into debt to some corporation in the city, and they bought out his house. His house is fairly small, and if you go in, you're likely to just hear him ranting about something until he solves his problem, a technique he calls rant-solving. It is quite interesting, but sometimes (like the rest of us), he is wrong. If you want to know his political stance, "screw right wings".

[Reaper on the other hand ... he does ... something](https://grim4reaper.github.io/Year11Notes/)? You might notice that his house looks pretty similar to Ed's, and I'll address this later. I don't have much to say about him, except that he is a little ... strange. These two are our 2nd generation immigrants.

Finally, we enter the revision of the town that you know now, the 3rd generation. I don't have much to say about them, as they only recently joined the town. [Firstly, we have Thomas, who has a very pleasant park, in which he grows his very own Jacaranda tree](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/), which I suspect he got from the Plains, or Shan-mei. If you want to know, his theme is actually Dracula (taken from monkeytype). It's quite popular around here, even Edward uses it.

[There is also Jonathan](https://supaqwerty.github.io/notes-dump/). He was accused for almost copying Ed's town page. I do know that he has friends who live in the metropolis, but I don't they have have any intent in joining us here.

[Finally, there is Shan-mei, who is d-](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/) [This program is interrupted by Edward. Mspicata is an idiot, don't listen to him]. She is the youngest of us, but also quite an active part of the community. She lived in the city for a while, but moved because she complained it was too cramped.
