- [M.spicata](https://spicata.99000000.xyz/) is me, the original founder of the Town. I won't say more in order to save sounding arrogant.
- [Edward](https://obsidiannotes-v-4.pages.dev/) is seen as the de facto and de juris leader of the Town, but is way too obsessed with attempting to establish a quartz majority. Dating the person 7 places down on this list.
- [notmario](https://notmario.github.io/thenotes/) is definitely *a* member of the Town. 
- [Mace](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/), the revolutionary, and also the king of the gaymering crime syndicate. Joined the Town for some apparent reason, and has not done anything much here.
- [Reaper](https://grim4reaper.github.io/Year11Notes/). Seems kind of edgy. Maybe it's just a phase. Also, if you go on his website, he steals your IP address.
- [Anonymous](https://anonymoof1528.github.io/into-the-shadow-garten/) has a whopping 7 pages. Often used by me as an example to why we should have a page limit on the Town. Apart from that, his notes are fine but he has an seizure on chat every once in a while.
- [Thomas](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/) is the owner of the Jacaranda tree at the back, but he's gone radio silent for a while now.
- [Jonathan](https://nottaro.github.io/littleroot/) is also often used as an example, specifically about the cookie-cutter nature of Quartz as it is used in the Town.
- [Shan-mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/) is a nice person with good ideals. I also don't know and haven't spent enough time with her to insult her.
- [Ï€-thagoras](https://pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen/), owner of the tastiest chickens of the Town. So far the only person to base their website on JSP. Not quite sure what he does.
- [Joel](https://rubver16.github.io/joles-notes/) is the stalagmite man. Haven't got anything else to say.
- [Athu](https://super-cookies.github.io/duk/) sucks. Contrarian and devil's advocate extraordinaire, and I hate him for it. Also has a tendency to over-think, and likes to flex his knowledge even when not necessary.
- [Tom](https://grimreaper2654.github.io/Notes/). I've only visited for his Town lore. Who knows what else goes on his website (I do, and it is a rip-off xob).
- [Loren](https://ionized-satellite-e99.notion.site/Loren-s-2023-Notion-cd03827de0a743468d9fb5a70413fc95), a *different* person given the context of the other members of the Town. Doesn't really matter though, and also brings a bit of new life into the Town. (again, lies in the 'not close enough to insult' area)
- [The Merchant](https://harzavad.github.io/the-merchant/) is a person I forgot even exists.
- [The Wanderer](https://rewind789.github.io/wanderer-archive/), another person I forget exists. 
- [Beatrice](https://beatricesychong.wixsite.com/notes) is a new member, but has had a notes website for quite a while now. Joined after a little feud with another organisation, but doesn't say much in the Town.
- [Claudia](https://cshc.notion.site/cshc/claudia-s-life-planner-c23280690bef46b79adee2d0773c5591). No comment.
- [Ajay](https://rjdjcool3.github.io/baju-s/) was silent when he joined the Town, a silence that I took personally. He is also another Quartz user >:-/.

Wow, I really don't have a lot to say about many of these people.
