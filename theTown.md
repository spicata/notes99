Welcome to the town.

I'm guessing that you came here cause of the sandstorm ravaging the desert, but if you stick around, I'm sure you'll find something you like. 

Feel free to browse my store while we wait for the sandstorm to pass. I bring stuff I find from my journey here. Don't worry it's all free, forever. I can always just find more. I also have greenhouse out back where I grow some stuff. If none of it is to you liking, go check out [Ed's tea and spaghetti restaurant](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.3/)[^1]. He's got a whole bunch of stuff there too.

I heard that there are two new people in town. they only recently moved in, so they might still be settling down, I'm not quite sure. I believe that [Thomas has planted some trees somewhere](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/). They look quite nice. [There is also "Reaper"](https://grim4reaper.github.io/Year11Notes), who is having some disputes with Ed. No clue why.[^2]

Across the road, you'll find two abandoned stores. I think that [notmario](https://notes.notmario.net/) and [Mace](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/) have moved out of town now. Their houses are still here, but they are not maintained. I also think that Dasindu should be somewhere around here, but I think a company from the city bought his house.

You know, there's a lot of free space here. You could always move here if you want. We can help you build your house. Besides, being here is probably better than trying to get by in the desert.

[^1]: He's already accidentally burnt it down twice now. I have to keep a floor plan just in case he does it again.
[^2]: Now that I look at it, all of their things look pretty similar.
