    <h1>the wonders of a forgotten web</h1>

      <p><img src="assets/digging.png" alt="digging" /></p>

<p>There is a Web out there that we don’t know about, one that is hidden away from plain-sight; a ‘forgotten’ web. No, not hidden like the Dark Web, just… lost.</p>

<p>We think we know how to navigate the internet, after all, we have search engines that allow us to do so. However, using a search engine is kind of like skimming the surface of the ocean and claiming to know what the entire ocean is like. In truth, because of the overwhelmingly large internet, it will never be possible to know everything that is on the internet.</p>

<h2 id="personal-websites">personal websites</h2>

<p>There is a very large collection of people’s own personal websites that probably will never make it onto the pages of Google search, whether that be due to things like lack of SEO optimisation, lack of viewers, or the simple fact that the crawler hasn’t indexed the site yet. Thus, most of these websites will probably never be discovered.</p>

<p>This is what I mean by the ‘forgotten’ Web, everything that will never make it onto these search engines. However, that doesn’t mean there is nothing to read here, you could probably spend weeks reading these websites and hopping over from one to another.</p>
