      <p>There are two types of electrochemical cells: galvanic cells, which onvert chemical potential energy to electrical energy; and electrolytic cells, which convert electrical energy to chemical potential energy.</p>

<p>Galvanic cells are made up of…</p>

<ul>
  <li>electrodes</li>
  <li>electrolyte solutions</li>
  <li>a salt bridge</li>
  <li>a voltmeter</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Anode and cathode are electrons. Anodes is where oxidation happens (losing electrons → becoming positive), and cathodes is where reduction happens (gaining electrons → becoming negative).</p>

<p>Electrolyte solutions contains the dissolved things.</p>

<p>A salt bridge contains ions. When there is a difference in charge, the salt bridge releases cations and anions to balance the charge. e.g. KCl, KNO3</p>

<hr />

<p>When a rod of metal is dipped into a solution of its won ions, it is in an equilibrium.</p>

<p>Anions move towards the anode, and the cations move towards the cathode.</p>
