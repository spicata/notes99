    <h1>town lore</h1>

      <p>If you’ve spent any time around us (especially Anonymous), then you may have heard of something along the Town lore. Of course, being a hot garbage mess, we can never agree on just one canon, but here’s what I think is the Town lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-old-town">the old town</h2>

<p>In the Town, there are two Towns: the old town and the new town. The old town was built on the rubbles of the once present Notes Coalition, and consists of spicata, Edward, ossac, Mace, and to an extent, Reaper and Anonymous too.</p>

<p>This part of the Town is a little bit more rundown than the rest of the Town, but also has the advantage of seniority, and exists in the general middle of the Town.</p>
