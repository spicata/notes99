        <h1>No Text</h1>
      
      <p>You know, we aren’t only limited to text when we create notes and other things like this. We have the pleasure of being on the internet, which means we can more effectively share other multimedia formats, such as images, videos, audio, and more. You don’t necessarily need to text in order to make your website, in fact, I think it would be much more interesting to place images and videos and audio recordings all over your website.</p>

<p>or in short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Images, especially little illustrations, are a great way way to grab attention, and diagrams are a very good way to understand concepts. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.</li>
  <li>Videos too; we watch Khan Academy or Crash Course, not read a really long document explaining this one topic.</li>
  <li>It’s easier to sit down on the bus or the train, it’s much easier to just pop open a podcast then it is to, say, read a massive document</li>
  <li>Truth is, it’s easier to watch multimodal content then it is to read text.</li>
</ul>
