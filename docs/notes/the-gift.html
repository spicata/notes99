      <p>The main thing the play does is that it confronts a possible reality that the audience faces, in order to make the question their own values, ideas, and attitudes. When Martin and Chloe vow to always tell the truth, the facade that many people create is destroyed, and the characters are free to say things (oft terrible things) that they would not otherwise. The coming forward of these things may resonate with the audience, who probably will not share the same beliefs, but can still be prompted to analyse their own values more critically.</p>
