        <h1>Boyle's Law</h1>
      
      <p>When there is a greater volume, gas particles will have less chance to hit each other or hit walls, and so the pressure decreases. Or in a sense, the forces will stay the same but the area will increase, and so the pressure will decrease (as the formula). The reverse is true.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Boyleâ€™s Law: at a given temperature, the <strong>V</strong>olume of a given mass of gas in inversely proportional to the <strong>P</strong>ressure.</li>
  <li>PV = k, where k is a constant</li>
  <li>Alternatively, P1V1 = P2V2, where x1 is initial and x2 is final.</li>
  <li>Systems like to be constant, so if a change is made, it will try to revert to its original state</li>
</ul>
