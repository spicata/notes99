    <h1>close reading mistakes</h1>

      <p>First of all. What is happening (plot)? Who is the text about (characters)? Where and when is it happening (setting)?</p>

<p>Second of all. Technical things, like language devices, structure, style, genre, descriptive language, generic techniques.</p>

<p>Third of all. Finally, your reading. What are the consequences of characterâ€™s actions. How are people represented. Where are our sympathies directed? Who is empowered? What are the symbols? How about context?</p>
