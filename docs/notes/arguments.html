      <p>An argument needs to have a reason, an inference (e.g. “therefore”), and a conclusion (i.e. find a causal relationship).</p>

<p>Thus, reason — (so) –→ conclusion. This is provable by logic.</p>

<p>If we flip it around, then we get an explanation. So… conclusion — (because) –→ reason. This is not provable by logic.</p>

<hr />

<p>If an argument is deductively valid: if P, then Q. <em>If it is raining, then there must be clouds. Because it is rainy, so there are clouds.</em> But deductively valid does not need to be true. <em>If my hand is itchy, then I will win the lottery</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think Marvel makes bad movies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are the problems here?</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is no reason. Why does Marvel make bad movies.</li>
  <li>It is an opinion. It is not falsifiable. I can show you that Marvel doesn’t make bad movies, but you might still think that.
    <ol>
      <li>Unless I gaslight you or something.</li>

<p>Also.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marvel films are formulaically generated for mass appeal and profit, lacking the substance of older films with strong artistic vision.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>Define ‘formulaically generated for mass appeal’ and ‘lacking … strong artistic vision’</li>
  <li>Prove that Marvel films are formulaically generated and that the older films have strong artistic vision.</li>
  <li>Why does this make it bad???</li>
</ol>
