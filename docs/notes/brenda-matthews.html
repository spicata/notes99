    <h1>Brenda Matthews</h1>

      <ul>
  <li>Metthews was taken away shortly after the stealing of children was illegalised, so she is not technically or officially considered a part of the Stolen Generation</li>
  <li>Watch the last daughter</li>
  <li>Brenda is not white, but also does not fit into the other ‘blackfellows’ (because she was taken away)</li>
  <li>The Government took Brenda and her 6 other siblings; no goodbyes. Why? Because apparently they were neglected → causes a lot of emotional hurt</li>
</ul>
