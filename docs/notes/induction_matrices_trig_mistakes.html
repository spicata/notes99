    <h1>mistakes made: induction, matrices, and trigonometry</h1>

      <p>NO, WHAT? I WROTE -8 INSTEAD OF 8 (1).</p>

<p>The second equation (-12x+10y=-32) is a scalar multiple of the first line (6x-5y=16) (multiply by -2). Hence, they are describing the same line. There are an infinite number of intersecting points, hence, there are infinite solutions. (1)</p>

<p>Handwriting? Why does that 1 looks like a 4? (1)</p>

<p>Reflection across y=-x was [(0 -1)(-1 0)], not [(-1 0)(0 -1)]. Dammit. (2)</p>

<p>You had to include that it was true for all integers K. e.g. $K \in\mathbb{Z}$ (1)</p>

<p>You had to justify how you got from Matrix 1 to [(-1 0)(0 3)]. Classpad is not good enough. (1)</p>
