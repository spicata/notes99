      <ul>
  <li>Historical fiction with a focus on Australian Literature</li>
  <li>Australian literature is a reflecion of Australian society and history, even if that text is set in the future. This is historical fiction: a story that takes back in the past, which attempts to capture the details of the time period as accuretly as possible, often depicting historical events (but might not be 100% correct).</li>
  <li>According to the Historical Novel Society, it must be written at least 50 years after the events, or written by someone who was not alive tldr distance + different perspective</li>
</ul>

<p>Or it could be…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alternate history</li>
  <li>pseudohistory</li>
  <li>timeslip (time-travel)</li>
  <li>historical fantasies (e.g. king arthur)</li>
  <li>multiple-time (e.g. timeslip at many times at all times)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hm. Sounds strange. How is it possible for something to be both history and fiction at the same time? Consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the setting</li>
  <li>the plot</li>
  <li>characters</li>
  <li>dialogue (be very careful, their idioms, register, …)</li>
  <li>conflict
These are narrative things. Historical fiction is fiction with a historical aspect.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-to-keep-in-mind">things to keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AIATSIS map of Indigenous Australia → an attempt ot map out the cultures, social, and language groups of Aboriginal Australians.</li>
  <li>European consrtuction of the Great South Land (1570). A lot of the unkown is just filled in with imagination (look at the giant squids and dragons and massive crocodiles etc.) Australia was a unknown place that is dangerous and mysterious</li>
</ul>

<p>That is the end of the section</p>

<h2 id="history-and-fiction">history and fiction</h2>

<p>The binary between history and fiction is not as binary as it seems. Foucalt says that relationship between history and fiction is more important.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hayden White: history is a re-presentation</li>
  <li>History relies on interpretation and representation, just like fiction</li>
  <li>History is not fictional or false,  but it isn’t entirely objective either.
Some people are left out in history, and thus historical fiction fills in this gap in the record. Putting history in a medium.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most historical fiction is, I like to think, in dialogue with the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="australia">australia</h2>

<p>As Australia started get more clear in the record, the two maps in the section prior finally went ham. One died, the other thrived; causing Australian historical archetypes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drover/Stockman</li>
  <li>ANZAC</li>
  <li>Lost children</li>
  <li>Bushranger</li>
  <li>underdog (egalitarian nature maybe?)</li>
  <li>bush versus city</li>
  <li>indigenous mystic - respected but marginalised</li>
</ul>

<p>And also some emerging themes too:</p>
<ul>
  <li>belonging</li>
  <li>dealing with historical guilt</li>
  <li>facing the limitations of national identity</li>
  <li>violence and masculinity</li>
  <li>trauma</li>
  <li>Reconciliation</li>
  <li>indigenous self-determination (THE referendum)</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes are when the audience says “no no I want something different”, and we get:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Experimentation</li>
  <li>Revisions</li>
  <li>Recreations</li>
  <li>Parodies</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="realism">realism???</h2>

<p>Magic realism is realism but with some magical elements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>by placing different cultures next to each other, we create dialogue between them</li>
  <li>by placing different interpretations beside each other, we create dialogue between histories</li>
</ul>
