    <h1>mistakes made: general chem</h1>

      <p>HCl is not an ionic substance. It is molecular. This should have been a dead giveaway for the Arrhenius model. (1)</p>

<p>A substance usually has the colour of any coloured ions that make it up. I read that for nickel, and proceeded to choose grey. (1)</p>

<p>CH3COO IS WEAK (1). It doesn’t fully ionise.</p>

<p>Be more careful. (enthalpy) (1)</p>

<p>Had to explain in reference to the diagram, specifically the shape and gradient. (1) Also, it increases the frequency of successful collisions. (1)</p>

<p>Pressure and volume is inversely proportional. This means it is curved. (1)</p>

<p>For the balloon in the fridge, should’ve specified that the force of collisions would have decreased due to decreasing kinetic energy. (1)</p>

<p>Listen to Pranav next time (2).</p>
