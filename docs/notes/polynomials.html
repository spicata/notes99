    <h1>polynomials</h1>

      <p>Polynomials are a sum of multiples of powers of a variable. For example, this is a polynomial:</p>

\[\text{Example A: }f(x)=x^{2}+3x+2\]

<p>The order or degree is the highest power. In example A, this is 2. For example, if a polynomial has roots p, q and r; then it can be written as.</p>

\[\text{Example B: }f(x)=a(x-p)(x-q)(x-r)\]

<hr />

<p>Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials work like normal. Division — and it’s always division — work slightly differently. These websites will explain it better than I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials-division-long.html</li>
</ul>

<p>The remainder will always have a smaller order than the divisor.</p>

<hr />

<p>If we were to write regular division like:</p>

\[n=Q\times D+r\]

<p>Then we can write polynomial division as:</p>

\[\text{Formula 1: }P(x)=Q(x)D(x)+R(X)\]

<hr />

<p>Polynomial division can also be written as:</p>

\[\text{Formula 2: }\frac{P(x)}{D(x)}=Q(x)+\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}\]

<p>Here are some algebraic fractions. Proper fractions have a higher order denominator. Improper fractions have a lower order denominator. Formula 2 is able to turn improper fractions into proper fractions.</p>

<p>Q: What if they have the same order?</p>

<hr />

<p>Don’t like division? You can use ‘Algebraic Juggling’ instead. Again, better explained in the Sadler textbook</p>

<p>It is more confusing though. :-/</p>
