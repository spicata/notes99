    <h1>polynomials</h1>

      <p>Polynomials are a sum of multiples of powers of a variable. For example, this is a polynomial:</p>

\[\text{Example A: }f(x)=x^{2}+3x+2\]

<p>The order or degree is the highest power. In example A, this is 2. For example, if a polynomial has roots p, q and r; then it can be written as.</p>

\[\text{Example B: }f(x)=a(x-p)(x-q)(x-r)\]

<h2 id="polynomial-division">polynomial division</h2>

<p>Addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials work like normal. Division — and it’s always division — work slightly differently. These websites will explain it better than I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials-division-long.html</li>
</ul>

<p>The remainder will always have a smaller order than the divisor.</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>If we were to write regular division like:</p>

\[n=Q\times D+r\]

<p>Then we can write polynomial division as:</p>

\[\text{Formula 1: }P(x)=Q(x)D(x)+R(X)\]

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>Polynomial division can also be written as:</p>

\[\text{Formula 2: }\frac{P(x)}{D(x)}=Q(x)+\frac{R(x)}{D(x)}\]

<p>Here are some algebraic fractions. Proper fractions have a higher order denominator. Improper fractions have a lower order denominator. Formula 2 is able to turn improper fractions into proper fractions.</p>

<p>Q: What if they have the same order?</p>

<p>Don’t like division? You can use ‘Algebraic Juggling’ instead. Again, better explained in the Sadler textbook</p>

<p>It is more confusing though. :-/</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>Since the order of the remainder must be smaller than the order of the divisor, IF the divisor has an order of 1, THEN the remainder has an order of 0. From that, we can get…</p>

<h2 id="remainder-theorem">remainder theorem</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a polynomial P(x) and a number a, the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x-a) is P(a)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>\(\text{If 'a' happened to be -2... }P(x)=(2x^2+3x+4)(x+2)+7\)
\(\text{and also... }P(-2)=2(-8)+7(4)+10(-2)+15=7\)</p>

<p>Note that the remainder and P(a) are the same.</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>This is because…</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
P(x)&amp;=Q(x)(x-\alpha)+r \\
P(\alpha)&amp;=Q(\alpha)(\alpha-\alpha)+r=r
\end{aligned}\]

<h2 id="factor-theorem">factor theorem</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a polynomial P(x), (x-a) is a factor P(x) if and only if P(a)=0</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Factor theorem is just a special case of the remainder theorem.</p>

<p>Suppose (x-a) is a factor of P(x). Then the remainder when divided by 0. Hence, by the remainder theorem, P(a)=0. Conversely, suppose that P(a)=0. Then the remainder of P(x) / (x-a) must be 0. Hence, (x-a) is a factor of P(x).</p>

<h2 id="misc-information">misc. information</h2>

<p>Every real polynomial with an order higher than 0 can be factorised as a product of n linear factor. (They can all be divided by <strong>something</strong>). (Some of the linear factors may be complex)</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>If z is a complex solution to a polynomial equation, then so is the conjugate. Because they come in pairs, odd degree polynomials must have at least one real solution, hence at least one real x-intercept.</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>If (x-a)^n is a factor of P(x)…</p>

<p>If n is 1, it will just pass through. If it is even, it will touch it. If it is an odd larger than 1, it will inflect.</p>
