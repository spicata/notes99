<p><em>The Feminine Mystique</em>: a book by Betty Friedan, 1963.</p>

<p>This book sparked the second wave of feminism.</p>

<p>The book explores “the problem with no name”, that is, the unhappiness of women in traditional roles, such as of a housewife or a mother. The presumption that women would be happy with these roles is what is called the “feminine mystique”. This coincided with a growing number of women that would drop out of education so that they could marry earlier (<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/">how ironic</a>).</p>

<p>Media, as controlled by men, also propagated this myth of a happy housewife vs an unhappy careerist.</p>

<p>Whereas early feminists (first wave), fought for important rights, this work looks at the social aspect.</p>

<p>Critiqued for not including experiences of black and lesbian women. Black women already had to get careers for money.</p>
