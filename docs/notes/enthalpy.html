    <h1>enthalpy</h1>

      <p>Internal energy is equal to the sum of kinetic and potential energy of a particle. Temperature is the average kinetic energy of molecules, thermal energy is the component of internal energy due to temperature, heat is the transfer of energy from a higher to a lower temperature object.</p>

<p>Enthalpy (H) is the measure of energy stored in a system. During reactions, the energy in a system will change: enthalpy change (delta H). Measure this energy change by the change in temperature of the surroundings.</p>

<p>Enthalpy is measured in kJ mol^-1, and is measured at a constant pressure, e.g. STP.</p>

<ul>
  <li>exothermic vs endothermic</li>
</ul>

<p>For reactions to happen, some energy must be put into the sample. This is because the reactants need to break the bonds between them (this takes energy) and then reform. The state between them is the activated complex/transition state, which is temporary and highly unstable. That energy that is required is known as the activation energy.</p>

<p>Exothermic reactions would have a negative enthalpy change, because it will lose some of its energy to the environment. Endothermic reactions would have a positive enthalpy change, because it will have more stored energy after the reaction. Please put the +.</p>

<p>Some reactions will have both a forwards and a reverse reaction. One of them is exothermic, and one of them is endothermic. Does that imply that some things don’t have reverse reactions?!?!?</p>

<p>Bond-making is exothermic. Bond-breaking is endothermic. This is also the reason why the enthalpy bump exists. Different bonds have different enthalpies, which some people have decided to measure. If a molecules has several bonds, then the bond enthalpy is all of them added up.</p>

<p>You can put the heat produced/absorbed as an actual thing in the equation, or placed as “delta H = …”. NB: The thing on “delta H = …” will be counter-intuitive, dH would be negative if heat is released.</p>
