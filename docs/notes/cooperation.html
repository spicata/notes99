      <blockquote>
  <p>“Power is freedom.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I had to give one maxim that had decided much of my actions until now, that would have been it. After all, only once you have power, are you able to change the world around you. And the only way to get that power is through control.</p>

<p>However, things have happened, and this statement no longer seems are true as it once did to me. I still believe that power is freedom, but it means nothing if you don’t have people around you. No man can rule alone.</p>

<p>Cooperation is truly sweet, and brings a spark to life that power itself cannot. It is only when you begin to work with others — bounce off of each others ideas — that stuff gets done. The ability for human cooperation is truly wild, and everything contains it. Nightfall City, Minecraft Servers, tilde.town, and society. The Town is built on this basis of cooperation, even outside of making notes and building websites. Without this, the Town could not have existed. And so, it feels wrong to try to rob this away from the Town. Instead, I find myself more and more inclined to give back to it.</p>
