    <h1>the town</h1>

      <p><em>After having wandered the desert for what seems like weeks, you finally encounter a little settlement ravaged by sandstorms. A little dusty sign says “The Town”</em></p>

<p><em>You enter the half-broken and dusty wooden shack off to the side, and dust the sand off of your cloak. You take off your goggles, finally seeing the warmly lit inside of the cottage.</em></p>

<p>“Oh, a traveller … we don’t usually get much around these parts. I hope the sandstorm outside treated you well.</p>

<p>“I guess introductions are in order. I’m Spicata, the owner of the store you’ve just happened to have stumbled into. Nice to meet you.</p>

<p><em>He puts out his hand. You shake it</em></p>

<p>“And this settlement? This is the Town, as you probably saw from the sign outside … if it hasn’t been knocked over yet. I would give you a tour around, but the storm outside would make that a little hard.</p>

<p>“I could give you a tour around this store instead, if you want, while we wait for the sandstorm to die off. Come, follow me.</p>

<p><em>He takes you out through a back door, into a greenhouse housing exotic plants from places all over. Dashes of green, purple, orange, and pink fills the view.</em></p>

<p>“This is <a href="">the nursery</a>, where I plant the plants I’ve collected over my journeys. Most of them are from the Plains, if you’re curious … feel free to take any fruits from the garden here.</p>

<p><em>You gesture over to the wooden trapdoor on the ground</em></p>

<p>“Oh that? Those are <a href="">the archives</a>, old growths that have gotten to big for me to effectively control. So, I buried them. You could always go down to explore them, though they may grow dangerous the further on you go.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you to it then, come back into the store when you want.”</p>

<p><em>You come back from the nursery, finding Spicata sitting down by his desk, head hunched over some papers.</em></p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve finished exploring the gardens? Well, there’s not much left to show, and the sandstorms still going strong. If you want, you could go down that left hallway, see the random comics I draw when I have time on my hands. Waiting for these sandstorms to be over can get boring, after all.”</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>“Hey. The sandstorms died down, we can finally give you that tour of the Town that I promised you. Come, let’s have a look around.</p>

<p><em>He leads you to a pile of ash that lies beside his own store.</em></p>

<p>“This would have been the first stop our journey, had you come a little earlier. Now, there’s not much left, as you can probably see. It’s a real shame. In case you were wondering, this sad pile of debris used to be the glorious house of the Town’s ex-mayor. Now that he’s left, his house was left unmaintained, until it burned down one day, probably all the volatile chemicals he stored all over the place.</p>

<p>“Instead, we’re gonna have to go to the other side of the old Town, over there. Here, we’ve got two of the oldest houses in Town, both owned by very talent programmers. Both of them have gone through their fair share of iterations, and these are the ones that you’ll find now. Despite their seniority, the two who live in each house respectively don’t participate much in any of the Town’s business.</p>

<p>“Well … the older of the two does usually helps us set up things around Town. so there’s that.</p>
