<h2 id="an-exposition">An Exposition</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Welcome to the Oasis, the plains of dreams. Anything you wish to build, you can make it here. Anything you need find, you can find it here. This newly found area will be available to everyone, it’ll be built by everyone, and by for everyone. With these fertile hills, you can do all you want. This Oasis will revolutionise the world, the power handed down to the average person.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This Oasis is dead. All we inherit is the Desert, the brutal and lonely remnants of the ‘plains of dreams’ that once looked so prosperous. The sands of time blow by, having already long buried the great towns and communities that lied before, forever dead and forgotten, never to be found ever again by anyone who treads these paths.</p>

<p>Now, all you see here in these sandy plains are nomads, the deserted, and pirates, fighting to survive in the constant sand-storm, either looking for, or seeking refuge from the Metropolis.</p>

<p>All that’s left is the Metropolis, the gleaming city at the heart of this accursed continent. It stands tall, it’s supposed prosperity only bringing even more and more influence and power to itself. Controlled by a few, fragile and frightened oligarchs, they control peoples lives, and yet they feud, hoping to accrue even more power, and they send their mercenaries<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and armies to clash, only hurting the normal citizens within their massive walls. Their people stand divided.</p>

<p>This mega-project stays funded by transcontinental railway, always feeding this never-satiated beast of a city with resources… and people. Constantly getting raided and taken over by the pirates, resources eventually seep out into the hands of the regular person, but crackdowns on these organisation grow by the day, and the train grows more and more secure.</p>

<p>However, humans, being humans, did not stay content with this situation, and thus more independent, albeit small, communities began cropping up across the desert, and some were able to persist, even in the shifting sands and sandstorms. The Town was one of them, and now we stand here, independently accruing and growing resources.</p>

<h2 id="the-town">The Town</h2>

<p>I am not very smart, and nothing I have to say is rather witty. However, I do have a dream to take back this desert, and to lessen the influence that the Metropolis has on everything and everyone. I just happened to surround myself with some similar people, and we started what became the Town. Now, we’ve reached a point where people will join, not because they share my dream, but because they wish to be a part of a community, and besides, it’s pretty novel. And I’m alright with that.</p>

<p>A collection of gardens, of residences, and of shops. A group of people finding and making information and resources, becoming smarter, becoming wiser. Some friends, having fun. All of that, is what the Town. Nothing clear-cut, nothing grand, just a group of people.</p>

<p>So, if you want to help take back this Desert, and make an Oasis once again; if you want to make plant a garden or make a house; if you want to become smarter; or if you want to have fun, then please, come join this Town<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="residents">Residents</h2>

<p>I’m M.spicata, but you can call me spicata if you want. I’m the owner of this little corner of the Town you are in right now. I like to call it spicata99+, and it’s a part of a wider complex<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, which has a whole bunch of stuff that might interest you. Of course, you can stay here at spicata99+, listen to what I have to say. Otherwise, you can go to the garden just outside and take some resources for your own. If you want to read something funny, you could check out <a href="https://xob.99000000.xyz">the xob comics I have above</a>. And if you want to dive deeper, you can also always <a href="https://archive.99000000.xyz">go to the archives</a>.</p>

<p>There are other people here, of course, and you can go read their names on the <a href="https://town.toomwn.xyz">Town’s roll call</a>, but I’ll just talk a little about the most notable people here.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ve got Edward, the current mayor of the Town. He’s the one in charge and also the one that manages the <a href="https://the.toomwn.xyz">current Town centre</a>. He owns a <a href="https://ed.toomwn.xyz">spaghetti–tea house store just around the corner</a>, which is the second oldest establishment in this Town. He knows a lot about Chemistry, and he’ll tell you if you are curious. On the other hand, if you want to entertain yourself, you can always just <a href="https://ed.toomwn.xyz/Writings/">check out his ideas</a>, which is always fun to read.</p>

<p>You’ve also got <a href="https://pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen/">Pi-thagoras’ Chicken Pen</a>. He’s probably got the cleanest houses around, and his uses diagrams throughout to help explain the concepts that he’s learnt from around the Desert, so they are very good, in my opinion. <del>Also, his chickens are tasty.</del></p>

<p>Then you’ve got <a href="https://ionized-satellite-e99.notion.site/Loren-s-Garden-Cafe-cd03827de0a743468d9fb5a70413fc95">Loren’s Garden Cafe</a>, a neat little, well… cafe, where you can admire the flowers, and the fish in the ponds whilst having your morning coffee.</p>
