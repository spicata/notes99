    <h1>iceberg</h1>

      <p>Knowledge is like an iceberg. Above the surface, there is the things you can see, or test, easily. This is the things that you can actively recall, things that you know you know. Below the surface, there is the stuff you can’t see, the realm of recognition. This is a more ‘innate’ or intuitive realm. Most of your knowledge lies here, things like recognising words, places, people, that you didn’t even knew that you knew.</p>
