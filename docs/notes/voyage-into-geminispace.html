      <p>Hello astronaut! Are you ready to to jump into the Gemini<strong>space</strong>?</p>

<p>Okay that’s enough of that analogy. So recently, I found the Gemini protocol, which I thought was pretty neat. It is essentially what I kind of wanted to have happened to the Town. Of course, being on the internet, you can always visit it in places <a href="gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/">like this</a>.</p>

<p>I lied. If you are using a regular browser to view my website, such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc. then you will not be able to visit that page. That would be because it uses the Gemini protocol. So, what is this protocol?</p>

<h2 id="https">https://</h2>

<p>If you’ve been on the internet for a hot second, then you would know that at the start of every URL, there is this weird https:// thing. This is because the modern internet uses the https protocol, however, this is (as we’ve seen) not the only one that exists. There are other protocols, like the gopher and gemini protocols (as well as all the ones that the dark-web uses).</p>

<p>Think of it as entirely different ‘internets’, essentially.</p>

<p>In order to access the Geminispace, you need a special browser (AKA clients), such as <a href="">Amfora</a>, <a href="">Lagrange</a>, <a href="">or others</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve hopped</p>
