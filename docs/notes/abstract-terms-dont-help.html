    <h1>abstract terms dont help</h1>

      <p>TEEEL structure → topic, evidence, explain, elaborate, and link. This is the stock structure of paragraphs that (our) school taught. However, this brings up some things I find doesn’t help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the difference between explain and elaborate? What do we even explain or elaborate?</li>
  <li>What exactly is a topic sentence? How does it differ from thesis sentences?</li>
  <li>Are links just the same as topic? Why even have them then.</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting with topic sentence, how is it different to thesis? The use of these two very similar words that both start with T and has two syllables does not really help to distinguish them. A better name would be like ‘sub-thesis’, because it narrows down to focus on one aspect.</p>

<p>There is no fault on evidence, that is fair enough.</p>

<p>Explain… what exactly? This word is quite very vague, and doesn’t really tell you much. Apparently what your teacher wants in it is techniques, so why no just call this step techniques.</p>

<p>Elaborate is another one of these terms, what exactly is it that you are elaborating? The word itself means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>develop or present (a theory, policy, or system) in further detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn’t that just… writing a longer explanation? Teachers usually explain it like ‘oh, analyse the quote’. Then a fitting name would be analysis.</p>

<p>If you are writing links — like, full-fledged links — then stop.</p>

<p>Sub-thesis, evidence, techniques, analysis (SETA). Literally didn’t change anything except the name, and it explains itself a lot better.</p>
