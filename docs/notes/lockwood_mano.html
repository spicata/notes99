      <p><em>Some (class-wide) notes and planning on “The Animals of Lockwood Manor”</em></p>

<p>Class is not just money. Higher classes owns the means of production (land). This leads to the class distinctions, of social status/rank, tradition/family, taste, and education. People can be rich (you win a lottery), but you don’t have land and property.</p>

<p>Character: 1st person narrator, probably young, probably wealthy (upper-class), anxious, probably female, Untitled.</p>

<p>Why female? (1) All of the other characters references are female viz. grandmother, mother, governess. (2) It is a Gothic text, hence the archetype of Gothic heroine. (3) Also, they are confined to the house. (I guessed wrong, lol)</p>

<p>Setting: Lockwood Manor (important!!!), creepy, in need of repair, empty, old.</p>

<hr />

<p>It could be a homage to the Gothic genre, especially <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Or mental illness. Or pandemic/isolation. Or uncanny (unheimlich) (familiar becomes unfamiliar) (liminal space). Or <strong>THE</strong> house. Or class or Marxist. Or gendered reading (women stuck in domestic spaces). Or WWII.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… suggests that the domestic space is one wherein women are trapped within confining and outdated gender roles. By paying homage to Gothic texts such as <em>Jane Eyre</em>, Healy constructs a vulnerable first person narrator who seems to be lost and swallowed up by the titular Lockwood Manor.<br />
