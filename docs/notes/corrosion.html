    <h1>corrosion of metals</h1>

      <p>I think I might be going rusty. And so is Blaze™.</p>

<p>Dry/direct corrosion is when the metal reaction occurs with oxygen from the air, to make a metal oxide. It forms a protective layer on the surface of the metal, which protects the rest of the metal (passivation: making the metal unreactive because surface layer). Aluminium and chromium form a protective layer, so it’s useful.</p>

<p>Like when sodium reacts with air.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wet/indirect corrosion is when a metal reaction occurs with oxygen (air) and water. What the hell?</p>

\[\begin{align}
Fe_{(s)}\to Fe^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2e^{-} \\
Fe^{2+}_{(s)}\to Fe^{3+}_{(aq)} + e^{-}
\end{align}\]

<hr />

<h2 id="rates">rates</h2>

<p>These factors will change the rate of rusting…</p>

<ul>
  <li>concentration of oxygen - more oxygen → more reactions</li>
  <li>temperature - increase kinetic energy, but solubility of oxygen decreases</li>
  <li>pH - acidic solutions increases the rate of rusting</li>
  <li>conductivity of aqueous solution - it will increase the rate of rusting, somehow</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="prevention">prevention</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you cover it in a sacrifical metal, it will get corroded instead, so the thing you want won’t get rusted.</li>
  <li>Any physical layers will prevent rust, so things like paint and plastic. Oils and grease also works.</li>
  <li>Alloying</li>
  <li>Cathodic protection</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tinning">tinning</h3>

<p>This includes coating iron or steel in a thin layer of tin. The tin will oxidise, and it will passivate the surface. But… also if it’s damaged, the iron will corrode. (It is a noble layer)</p>

<h2 id="galvanizing">galvanizing</h2>

<p>This includes coating iron or steel in a thin layer of zinc. Zinc oxidises more readily, and so it is a sacrifical layer.</p>

<h2 id="cathodic-protection">cathodic protection</h2>

<p>Turn that galvanic cell into a electrolytic cell (see <a href="electrochemical_cells.html">electrochemical cells</a>)</p>

<h2 id="stainless-steel">stainless steel</h2>

<p>Stainless steel is a alloy, including chromium. Chromium is more reactive than iron, and so it will oxidise first.</p>
