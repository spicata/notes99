        <h1>a great life</h1>
      
      <p>sometimes, we lose faith in the world we live in. life is going to hell, world is ever dying. and so, it is easy to lose hope, closet ourselves from the hostile universe we inhabit.</p>

<p>but that is not all life has to offer. friends and family. lots of little people cooperating to build a better world for themselves; to see all these people work together to create something that none could have ever dreamed of themselves is truly beautiful. it gives you a little bit of hope back into life.</p>

<p>and oh, the emotions you can feel. every ounce of it is worth it.</p>
