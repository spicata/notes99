    <h1>polar form of complex numbers</h1>

      <p>Complex numbers can be represented in Cartesian (AKA rectangular) form. This is the (x+yi) form. However, they can also be represented in polar form.</p>

<hr />

<p>First of all, why even have a different form? Well, in Cartesian form, addition and subtraction are preferred over multiplication and division. Polar form fixes this problem, but more on that later.</p>

<hr />

<p>When we do addition with complex numbers, we can easily visualise it by looking at the Cartesian plane. It is just a translation.</p>

<p>However, what <strong>is</strong> complex multiplication? How do you show it graphically?</p>

<p>When something is multiplied by ‘i’, it rotates around the origin 90’. If we multiply by THAT, we rotate by 45’.</p>

\[\text{THAT: }\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}i\]

<hr />

<p>Essentially, (when the modulus is 1) the angle that we need to rotate a point around the origin is equal to the angle that the number makes with the positive real number axis.</p>

<hr />

<p>Also, when we multiply it with a number like 3, then the modulus is increased by 3. That is just how it works.</p>

<p>I hope you get what I mean. ;-)</p>

<hr />

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The distance from the origin is called the ‘modulus/magnitude’ (</td>
      <td>z</td>
      <td>). The angle is called the ‘argument’ (θ).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So rewrite z=a+bi as…</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
z&amp;=|z|\cos \theta+i|z|\sin\theta \\
&amp;=|z|(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)
\end{aligned}\]

<p>This is the polar form.</p>

<p>NB: Every complex number has infinite arguments, because that’s how angles work. θ is actually the principle argument, which is -pi &lt; θ &lt; pi.</p>

<hr />

<p>Find the modulus with Pythagoras. Find the principal argument using tan. MAKE SURE IT IS IN THE RIGHT QUADRANT.</p>

<hr />

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Mathematicians are busy people, and so they like to abbreviate it to</td>
      <td>z</td>
      <td>cisθ</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr />

<p>How about complex conjugates of polar form? Well, just find the negative value of the argument. This is why the principle argument is represented from -pi to pi.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do we use polar form in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When something is multiplied by ‘i’, it rotates around the origin 90’. If we multiply by THAT, we rotate by 45’. (found earlier)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we use polar form, this multiplication becomes easier. As a general rule…</p>

\[r_{1}cis\alpha\times r_{2}cis\beta=r_{1}r_{2}cis(\alpha+\beta)\]

<p>Or as an example…</p>

\[2cis\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right)\times 3cis\left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right)=6cis\left( \frac{5\pi}{6} \right)\]

<p>NB: This may give a non-principle argument</p>

<hr />

<p>Division follows a similar rule. That is…</p>

\[\frac{r_{1}cis\alpha}{r_{2}cis\beta}=\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}cis(\alpha-\beta)\]
