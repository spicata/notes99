    <h1>halogens</h1>

      <p>Some quick trends: Boiling point and atomic radius increases downwards. Electronegativity decreases downwards. They are insoluble in water.</p>

<p>And also, we donâ€™t talk about astatine.</p>

<p>Halogens react with metals to form a metal halide.</p>

<p>A more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halogen. It does this by taking electrons. This means that the more reactive halogen is always reduced. The less reactive halogen is always oxidised. e.g.</p>

\[Cl_{2}+2KI\to 2KCl+I_{2}\]

\[Cl_{2}+H_{2}O\to HCl+HOCl\]

<p>The latter is a disproportionation reaction (see <a href="redox">redox</a>).</p>

<p>NB: The more reactive halogen want to become an ion. This is because this will give it a full valence electron shell.</p>

<h2 id="halides">halides</h2>

<p>Halides are anything containing a halogen.</p>

<p>Halogens will prefer to be dissolved in cyclohexane rather than water. When the chlorine water and KBr was mixed, it produced an orange layer and a pale yellow layer. When the chlorine</p>
