<ul>
  <li>connectors (connie) are people who know lots and lots of people, they are human directories. they know lots of people from lots of different fields.
    <ul>
      <li>a ‘linker’. it is their friend group, not yours</li>
      <li>friend paradox</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>mavens are people who are specialists in their field. when they discover something, they spread it.
    <ul>
      <li>different from Machiavelli, as mavens are sincere and they want to help people istead, rather than puttin gtheir own need first</li>
      <li>they help themselves by helping others; the help others by helping themselves</li>
      <li>not antisocial, rather, like connectors, they are also sociable and they share information like that</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>salesmen are people who are able to effectively ‘sell’ an idea to other people.
    <ul>
      <li>possible because of a natural exuberance</li>
      <li>even without speaking, they are able to spread their feelings (maybe like the mirror neurons)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>innovators are the people who create new ideas. they are the first adopters, however, the majority lags behind them. the above 3 act as translators, making it easier for the majority to accept it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="context">context</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the environment around a person is what shapes them. the little things specifically</li>
</ul>
