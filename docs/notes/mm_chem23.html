      <p>Exams are devastating. So, better to not make the same mistakes I do.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-11">Question 11</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider the follow substances: NH4Cl, Cl2, Br2, ICl. which of the following correctly ranks the substances in order of decreasing boiling point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NH4Cl has a higher boiling point than ICl, so the order is NH4Cl &gt; ICl &gt; Br2 &gt; Cl2.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-16">Question 16</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lewis was revisiting his notes on nanotechnology for his upcoming Chemistry exam and found the following points in his notes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Nanoparticles have a very large surface area to volume ratio, compared to bulk materials.</li>
    <li>Nanoparticles have properties that vary from the bulk material.</li>
    <li>Nanoparticls are structures with at least one dimension in the range of 1-100 um.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Only 1 and 2 are true, as um is <strong>micrometres</strong>, not nanometres.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-26b">Question 26b</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compare and contrast the structure of an atom of xenon-133 with the more common isotope xenon-131.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare: both have 54 protons and 54 electrons.</p>

<p>Contrast: one has 77 neutrons and the others have 79 neutrons.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-27a">Question 27a</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explain how lead can conduct electricity as a solid and a liquid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Solid and liquid lead have delocalised electrons. When potential difference is applied, electrons can flow through the structure. The flow of charged particles is a current of electricity.</p>

<p>Key term: carriers of charge</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-27c">Question 27c</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use you understanding of the structures of graphite and diamond to explain why both substances have a very high melting point, but have significantly different electrical conductivity as solids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both have a high melting point because they are covalent molecules. Many covalent bonds hold atoms together, which would require a large amount of energy to break. Graphite is a good conductor of electrictiy as its structure has delocalised electrons. Diamond is a poor conductor of electricity as all the electrons are fixed in covalent bonds.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-29c">Question 29c</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the grid below, plot a graph to show the trend in atomic radius for the elements in period 2 of the period table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use a curve of best fit, not a line of best fit.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-30a">Question 30a</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explain, in terms of bond-breaking and bond-making, why this reaction is endothermic.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="question-30b">Question 30b</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In terms of the system and surroundings, describe the energy transformation and energy transfer that takes places during this reaction.</p>
</blockquote>
