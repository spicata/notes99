    <h1>a story of plants and friendships</h1>

      <p>Imagine you have a plant. It’s in a greenhouse, along with other plants: those ones aren’t yours. This greenhouse is communal, you and your close group of friends share it. Though recently, you’ve noticed something strange. All the plants in that greenhouse is… blue. I mean sure, they are all <em>slightly different</em> shades of blue, but they are all blue nonetheless.</p>

<p>Well, I guess they’ve always been subject to the same climate, same nutrients, and — more generally — same conditions. And you and your friends all share similar tips for growing them, so I guess it makes that they’ve all grown similar. In fact, you guys probably even used the same vendor.</p>

<p>Though, it’s a like samey sometimes.</p>

<p>One day, when you’re out, you notice another greenhouse. One set up by a different group of people. <em>Weird</em>, you think, <em>I’ve never noticed that one</em>. You look in, and to your surprise the plants aren’t blue. They’re red! How interesting. How did they pull it off?</p>

<p>You wait there, and eventually find someone entering the greenhouse. You ask them what they did to keep these plants red. They tell you tips and tricks; they are different from the ones your friends tell you.</p>

<p>(In truth, they were also quite interesting in your blue plants, and so you told them your methods too.)</p>

<p>You go back to your greenhouse to try out the new things you’ve learned.</p>

<p>Sadly, your plants don’t just turn red. I don’t believe that’s how they work.</p>

<p>They do flourish with the new things you learnt, so it was still well worth it. But your quest to add different colours to your plant doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Again, you’re on that walk. And again, you find another greenhouse. This one is different from both yours and that red one. This one is expansive and … well, it almost feel overgrown! It’s not though, it’s still well-kept.</p>

<p>More impressively, the plants here are all different colours. Reds, oranges, purples, and greens. Some even look iridescent.</p>

<p>The people here are more than willing to give you a tour. You ask them about the different colours. <em>Oh, it’s simple</em>, they say, <em>just graft them</em>.</p>

<p>“Graft them”? They explain it to you, and they give you a bit of their own so you can go try it on your plant too.</p>

<p>And so you do. And it works! Your once blue plant has a bit of yellow coming out of it now. Mind you, it’s not that ugly overly-yellow yellow, more of a calm and pretty one.</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>With your new found knowledge, you go around, meeting new people, exploring new greenhouses: some small and some large, finding new coloured plants to graft yours with.</p>

<p>In time, your plant grows larger — from the new tips you’ve learnt about growing plants — and it grows more colourful, each new adventure giving you new colours.</p>

<p>Your friend catch on, and those you visit also notice it.</p>

<p>In time, will you see your greenhouse become even more colourful as your friends learn it too? Only time will tell.</p>

<img src="/assets/line.svg">

<p>You are like a plant. A plant that can choose to graft itself: you choose the people you meet and spend your time with. They can teach you things you’d never had learnt before.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you’ll meet people who will rub off their mannerism, speech patterns, and personalities off on you. They graft themselves onto you, and you onto them. In a sense, they give you more colour.</p>

<p>Your greenhouse may be comfortable, but in there — well — everything stays pretty much the way it already is.</p>

<p>Go out there, meet new people — doesn’t need to be lots — and learn. And most importantly, paint yourself multicoloured.</p>
