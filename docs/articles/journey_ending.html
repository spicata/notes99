    <h1>a journey that's ending</h1>

      <p>Well, here we stand now. At the beginning of the end of our journey. We can see the end of this road. There stands only 1 year in front of us. 1 year of stability and certainty. Whatever happens after that is something we don’t know yet.</p>

<p>It was fun up until now. Hopefully it will be like that until the end.</p>

<p>To a fun last year. A grand last year. The best last year. Let’s enjoy all of it, from our highs to our lows. Stick together and help each other through struggles. And let’s have some fun.</p>

<p>Good luck to my friends and my peers.</p>

<p>It’s not The End yet…</p>
