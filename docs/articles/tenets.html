      <p>ðŸŒ± this is a new and unpolished article. if you want, read it now. else, read it when it is finished i guess.</p>

<hr />

<p>spicata99 was founded one a particular dream, one that was shared by the very early town. at the time, edward had done a fair bit of articles written with a nice style, and so i left it at that. however, edward has since left the town and taken down his website, and so i will hum the melody i once sang.</p>

<h2 id="make-education-free-and-accessible">make education free and accessible</h2>

<p>education and information is one of the most valuable resources out there. food and water and air will let you survive, but learning is what allowed humanity to thrive.</p>

<p>it is truly saddening, then, that as the internet â€” and by extension, the world in general â€” matures, education becomes more and more closeted off to those who can afford it. what could have been the best vector for spreading information slowly became more and more of a pay-to-win style of system.</p>

<p>i (evidently) despise that. education SHOULD be a thing afforded to everyone. information SHOULD be shared.</p>

<p>and although my website is not the most refined of notes (it is barely usable), itâ€™s still here.</p>

<p>hopefully, the town can band together and write some bigger resources before the end of the year, although a lot of us are quite busy.</p>

<h2 id="death-to-corporations">death to corporations</h2>

<p>death to corporations. or rather, i would rather own my own things that to give them off to another company.</p>

<p>it is my personal belief that my files should be stored on my computer, my programs run on my computer, and that my data is mine. it should not have to be sold off to some cloud software.</p>
