      <h1 class="title">principles of spicata99</h1>
      
      <p>Despite how much of a mess spicata99 tends to be, there are some principles that I believe are pretty important to making this website, just like Edward’s principle of “[making] education free and accessible”. Much of this comes about because of a certain disdain I have towards the modern internet, and these principles are a culmination of that.</p>

<p>The principles are the following…</p>

<ol>
  <li>spicata99 will remain independent from any external sources. The content here is completely my own. (Independent)</li>
  <li>spicata99 will remain non-commercial. (Non-commercial)</li>
  <li>spicata99 will remain public. No addition barriers to entry will be put up. (Public)</li>
  <li>spicata99 does not store any information about you. No cookies and no trackers. (Invisible)</li>
  <li>spicata99 will attempt to uphold integrity. (Integrous)</li>
  <li>spicata99 will attempt to be as fast and simple as possible for the user. (Efficient)</li>
</ol>

<p>Being independent and non-commercial is because I don’t want the content here on spicata99 to be influenced by others. When we have others to please and profit margins to meet, the content we produce gets warped. This is especially apparent in the modern internet, where advertisements reign supreme.</p>

<p>There is another aspect to being independent. It is that I am able to control my website, and I put things on it. We are in an age where more and more of everything gets put onto certain, massive websites, such as Twitter and Facebook. Firstly, ignoring the glaring fact that a lot of the things put on these websites should have really been put on websites in the form of blogs or articles, such as expert opinions. But on the other hand, by putting it on these platforms, you concede your control over it.</p>

<p>Being public is a carry over from some of the founding principles of the Town: that education remains “free and accessible”. If spicata99 was not accessible easily, its ability to share information and give education is weakened. This is the whole idea of having public websites where people are able to share notes.</p>

<p>Being invisible should explain itself. There are countless websites that require your cookies and track you, when in reality, they really do not need it. Advertisements should be context-specific not user-specific, and I do not need every detail about you. I <strong>really</strong> could not care less.</p>

<p>Being integrous is another one of those things that should be self-explanatory. In an age of rash comments, and plainly incorrect information, being integrous is the least you could do. Don’t spread falsehoods, and be impartial.</p>

<p>Lastly, being efficient. Obviously, you do not want to wait for too long just to view notes. There is a virtue in being patient, but there is also a virtue in optimising your load times. So, simple and fast it is.</p>

<p>Because of these principles, spicata99 will probably feel a tad bit more personal. But I’m sure we can all use that in the mess that is the modern internet.</p>
