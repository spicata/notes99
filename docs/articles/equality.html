    <h1>equality != similarity</h1>

      <p>A: That article is saying that in an structure of equality, more differences emerge and then going on to say that ‘this’ is bad. It’s implying we should implement structural inequality.</p>

<p>B: No it’s not. It’s saying that people are inherently different, and hence it is wrong to make them the same in the structure of quote unquote equality.</p>

<p>A: But equality doesn’t need similarity. People can be different and still be equals.</p>

<p>B: What are you talking about? <strong>Equality means similarity!</strong> People can’t truly be equals, they are all different!</p>

<p>A: … What?</p>

<p>NB: I’m pretty sure B was wrong.</p>
