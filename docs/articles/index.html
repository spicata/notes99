    <h1><a href="/articles/xob_drawing.html">2023-11-27: what i've learnt from drawing xobs</a></h1>
    <p><p>Inspired by <a href="https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/articles/What-500-Days-At-The-Gym-Taught-Me-About-Self-Growth">another article by tacoz</a></p>

<p>Okay it turns out that i’ve drawn around 260 xobs, give or take a few (just in case you don’t know what xobs are, <a href="https://xob.99000000.xyz">check out the website</a>). So, what have i learnt from drawing that many xobs.</p>

<hr />

<p>Whimsy? That’s a word that a <em>certain member of the town uses often</em>. If you take everything to seriously, it makes it harder to actually enjoy it. That kind of ended up creating the xob drought of 2023 (lol, all of it was 2023).</p>

<p>Same kind of things happens everywhere else too. For example, the articles section of spicata99 (now its more of a blog) suffered from taking it too seriously. Of course, there are some advantages of this. It made me think about the articles I actually post a bit more. But also it took away some of the fun and whimsy of it, as Loren pointed out.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m completely okay when that happens to articles (for now). But xobs are meant to be this funny little thing.</p>

<p>So yeah, be less serious about xobs. It’s more fun that way.</p>

    <h1><a href="/articles/equality.html">2023-11-18: equality != similarity</a></h1>
    <p><p>A conversation I had.</p>

<p>A: That article is saying that in an structure of equality, more differences emerge and then going on to say that ‘this’ is bad. It’s implying we should implement structural inequality.</p>

<p>B: No it’s not. It’s saying that people are inherently different, and hence it is wrong to make them the same in the structure of quote unquote equality.</p>

<p>A: But equality doesn’t need similarity. People can be different and still be equals.</p>

<p>B: What are you talking about? <strong>Equality means similarity!</strong> People can’t truly be equals, they are all different!</p>

<p>A: … What?</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure B was wrong.</p>

    <h1><a href="/articles/css_changes.html">2023-11-12: more css changes</a></h1>
    <p><p>It hasn’t even been a month and I have already pushed out a new css change so feast your eyes upon this new layout. This new theme uses the same colour palette as JACARANDA — more specifically the Dracula theme.</p>

<p>Also, because of the new layout here, you can essentially think of it as a blog-lite.</p>

    <h1><a href="/articles/journey_ending.html">2023-11-05: a journey that's ending</a></h1>
    <p><p>Well, here we stand now. At the beginning of the end of our journey. We can see the end of this road. There stands only 1 year in front of us. 1 year of stability and certainty. Whatever happens after that is something we don’t know yet.</p>

<p>It was fun up until now. Hopefully it will be like that until the end.</p>

<p>To a fun last year. A grand last year. The best last year. Let’s enjoy all of it, from our highs to our lows. Stick together and help each other through struggles. And let’s have some fun.</p>

<p>Good luck to my friends and my peers.</p>

<p>It’s not The End yet…</p>

    <h1><a href="/articles/dojo_tournament.html">2023-10-30: the dojo tournament</a></h1>
    <p><p>Hyun’s Dojo is a group of tons of different animators. In December, they are going to be holding a tournament to decide who is the best animator among them, for which I am quite hyped.</p>

<p>So, uh, here are some of my favourite animators from the Dojo:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gildedguy</li>
  <li>Hyun</li>
  <li>MicroMist</li>
  <li>TJB</li>
  <li>Hatena360</li>
  <li>CatGod</li>
</ul>

<p>Would be amazing if any of these creators end up as ‘The Chosen One’. But of course, I would be very happy no matter the result of the tournament. Cheers to the best animator.</p>

    <h1><a href="/articles/pitch_meeting_two.html">2023-10-13: pitch meeting 2: discord but better</a></h1>
    <p><p>Idea: Imagine an chatting/communication app like Discord. Now imagine that, when you log in, the system says something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M.spicata</strong> has logged in. Say hi!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in channels you want.</p>

<p>Why: Well, firstly, when you meet your friend in real life, you don’t just silently approach them and then wait for them to say something. Secondly, it is just kind of nice. In IRC (an older protocol), when you log in, it does in fact say “M.spicata logged in”, and then people will say hi, which is nice.</p>

<p>Thirdly, having like a “just logged in” and a “log out” announcement gives definite bounds to your session. So that you don’t stay on for too long.</p>

<p>“But, just use IRC.” IRC sucks. As much as I adore previous protocols and things, I simply dislike IRC. Discord and co. are so much more convenient.</p>

<p>“But, I don’t want people to see when I log in.” Fair, so there should be a system like being invisible on Discord, where your existence is unannounced.</p>

<p>“But, I only want to show up on certain servers.” Just make like a toggle thing whether a server gets the introductions. Public servers default to “no introduction”, and private ones default to “introduction” (maybe). Also make it enable-able on DM groups.</p>

    <h1><a href="/articles/pitch-1.html">2023-10-01: pitch idea</a></h1>
    <p><p>If you’ve played Slime Rancher, you’ll know of Hobson’s notes. Those little things that you would hunt for to learn a little bit more about the story of the rancher that lived where you are now.</p>

<p>Now imagine something like that in real life. Imagine an app that will allow you to make notes at any location. When you (in the future), return back to that place, you’ll be able to read that note once again. Snapshots of a person long gone.</p>

<p>It would be cool. The whole point of it to maybe relearn about the story of a you that is no longer around.</p>

<p>Maybe you’d also be able to bundle your notes into a collection, then share it to others. You walk around and slowly learn of the story of a stranger, who you’ll never meet.</p>

<p>Except maybe a notification when you are in a certain range of a note, these notes should have no other indication. Finding Hobson’s notes was always a pleasant surprise. That feeling should be preserved. In a world obsessed about efficiency, you just happen to stumble across snippets of life. How cute.</p>

<p>These notes should not be treated like a social media of a sort. Things like comments, likes, and follows shouldn’t exist. Preferably, all the data could also be stored on your own device. A cloud is not necessarily needed. Logins too. (maybe make it only have a limited number of notes or you can’t make another note too close to one?)</p>

<p>A treasure vault of memories…</p>

    <h1><a href="/articles/mayor_guidelines.html">2023-10-01: mayor guidelines</a></h1>
    <p><p>The mayor’s job is to be admin on the Town discord server.</p>

<p>Do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ask for permission</li>
  <li>make changes when it would benefit the server</li>
  <li>moderate sometimes</li>
  <li>moderate when there is also a public outrage</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t (even if for a ‘joke’):</p>
<ul>
  <li>change other person’s nickname</li>
  <li>mute people</li>
  <li>delete messages</li>
  <li>kick/ban people</li>
  <li>remove people from a call</li>
  <li>delete channels</li>
  <li>give admin to your friends</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t follow the rules, and get removed from power (or if 75% of the members dislike your rule).</p>

<hr />

<p>We will elect a new mayor every quarter (or when one gets smote) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">approval voting</a>). Election period will be 3 days long.</p>
