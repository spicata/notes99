    <h1>pitch idea</h1>

      <p>If you’ve played Slime Rancher, you’ll know of Hobson’s notes. Those little things that you would hunt for to learn a little bit more about the story of the rancher that lived where you are now.</p>

<p>Now imagine something like that in real life. Imagine an app that will allow you to make notes at any location. When you (in the future), return back to that place, you’ll be able to read that note once again. Snapshots of a person long gone.</p>

<p>It would be cool. The whole point of it to maybe relearn about the story of a you that is no longer around.</p>

<p>Maybe you’d also be able to bundle your notes into a collection, then share it to others. You walk around and slowly learn of the story of a stranger, who you’ll never meet.</p>

<p>Except maybe a notification when you are in a certain range of a note, these notes should have no other indication. Finding Hobson’s notes was always a pleasant surprise. That feeling should be preserved. In a world obsessed about efficiency, you just happen to stumble across snippets of life. How cute.</p>

<p>These notes should not be treated like a social media of a sort. Things like comments, likes, and follows shouldn’t exist. Preferably, all the data could also be stored on your own device. A cloud is not necessarily needed. Logins too. (maybe make it only have a limited number of notes or you can’t make another note too close to one?)</p>

<p>A treasure vault of memories…</p>
