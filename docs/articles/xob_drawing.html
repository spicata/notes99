    <h1>what i've learnt from drawing xobs</h1>

      <p>Inspired by <a href="https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/articles/What-500-Days-At-The-Gym-Taught-Me-About-Self-Growth">another article by tacoz</a></p>

<p>Okay it turns out that i’ve drawn around 260 xobs, give or take a few (just in case you don’t know what xobs are, <a href="https://xob.99000000.xyz">check out the website</a>). So, what have i learnt from drawing that many xobs.</p>

<p>Whimsy? That’s a word that a <em>certain member of the town uses often</em>. If you take everything to seriously, it makes it harder to actually enjoy it. That kind of ended up creating the xob drought of 2023 (lol, all of it was 2023).</p>

<p>Same kind of things happens everywhere else too. For example, the articles section of spicata99 (now its more of a blog) suffered from taking it too seriously. Of course, there are some advantages of this. It made me think about the articles I actually post a bit more. But also it took away some of the fun and whimsy of it, as Loren pointed out.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m completely okay when that happens to articles (for now). But xobs are meant to be this funny little thing.</p>

<p>So yeah, be less serious about xobs. It’s more fun that way.</p>
