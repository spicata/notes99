- fracture old notions of the nation,
- to read the February 2008 Federal Parliament Apology to the Stolen Generations as one such negotiation between many local voices and concerns, and the idea of the modern nation as it looks ‘outwards’ to the global, acutely aware of and needing to respond to its global affiliations and responsibilities.
- patently different to Birch’s, more apocalyptic, but it has the same kinds of locatedness: this stretch which is ‘in my blood’, ‘this stretch of road…this stretch’; the local as the particular, the familiar and the intimately understood.
- Watson places the ancient and the contemporary ... violently up against each other.
- does not begin on a national stage, or in the use of universalising speakers. In different ways their poetry is necessarily entrenched in the local: intimate voices, places, knowledges.
- this contemporary poetry is located, questioning, still needing to remember the woundedness of the past.
- ‘colonisation of the mind’ is more pervasive and dangerous than physical domination
- dominant narrative locks the non-European subject into a Western world view.
- Indigenous: (sic) people as ‘the other’ as
‘untouchable’, ‘savage’, native, ‘the blacks’.
- go beyond the linear historical model of colonisation and view
it in a post-structuralist context.
- Postcolonial theorists and writers also
advance the creation of new hybrid spaces in-between, in which other identities beyond the colonial
binaries might be found. ‘Cultural identities are both fragmented and in a constant state of flux’
- ‘colonial empires both fear and engender biological as well as
intellectual hybridities’
- also serves to
highlight Watson’s hybridity and the politics of being urban, Aboriginal.
- In the loose-limbed structure of the verse, its minimal punctuation and fluid rhythms, the power of anger and loss slowly mounts in the surreal 'dingo longue'. The anger is directed against systemic degradation, instituionalisation, technological and capitalist horrors
- Watson addresses a double past, a double ontology. ... there is the past of oppression and the past of land, dignity, custom, storytelling, song.
- ... but there is equally a gothic, macabre imagination at work
- These poem reclaim memory as sacred process: first the remembering, then the willingness to listen and to act.
- He clear-sightedly and prophetically depicts the psychic, spiritual and physical payments being made by Aboriginal Australians. But as well as the protests of such representations, Watson calls for a clear-sighted and listening response — not least from his readers — to the lives and dreams of contemporary urban Aboriginal Australians.
- It’s a poem which lashes out at the
commodification of memory by both indigenous and non-indigenous. ... It’s a poem which lashes out at the
commodification of memory by both indigenous and non-indigenous.
- current “gothic period” in cultural criticism, “characterised by an outpouring of often
densely theoretical work on trauma, mourning, and various aspects of contemporary late
capitalist ‘wound culture’”.
- on
might move into the future: without forgetting the horrors of the past, but also
restoratively, not forever dragging victimhood and horror behind it.
- In Freud’s context, it is not strictly true that mourning is “anti-commemorative” ... "In mourning the world has become impoverished and empty; during
melancholia, it is the ego itself"
- Who is offering the apology? The
agent who perpetrated the “mistreatment” and the blemishes of course: but then “we”
becomes “the nation”, “the laws and policies of successive Parliaments and governments”, “We the Parliament of Australia”. Powerful figures, and impersonal and
invisible at best.
- memory is bound up with particular conceptions of time.
The ghosts and traumas of the past are symbolically relegated to that past,
- Hauntedness as permeating any understanding of the future
- Past, present and future are haunted, because individuals, communities and nations are
memory animals. But memory does not offer stability and solidity.
- Rather, the post-colonial poetry of
Australian Indigenous poets enables – and is the product of - active, imaginative,
historical remembering, and refiguring into the future.
- Knowledge, in all Aboriginal systems of information, is specific
to the place and to the people ... one of the most important aspects
of Aboriginal knowledge systems is that they do not universalise.
Moreover, the fact that knowledge is localised and specific is one
of the keys to its value.
- cars and
roads to represent and critique colonialism and to assert Aboriginal identity
and culture.
- identifies these technologies with the
settler/invader,

- direct experience ... after having the experience, then writing them down in poetic form
- advise you to read them from the beginning ... only use a few
- thought it was symbolic, but turned out to be very literal ... metaphors
