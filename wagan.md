- fracture old notions of the nation,
- to read the February 2008 Federal Parliament Apology to the Stolen Generations as one such negotiation between many local voices and concerns, and the idea of the modern nation as it looks ‘outwards’ to the global, acutely aware of and needing to respond to its global affiliations and responsibilities.
- patently different to Birch’s, more apocalyptic, but it has the same kinds of locatedness: this stretch which is ‘in my blood’, ‘this stretch of road…this stretch’; the local as the particular, the familiar and the intimately understood.
- Watson places the ancient and the contemporary ... violently up against each other.
- does not begin on a national stage, or in the use of universalising speakers. In different ways their poetry is necessarily entrenched in the local: intimate voices, places, knowledges.
- this contemporary poetry is located, questioning, still needing to remember the woundedness of the past.
- ‘colonisation of the mind’ is more pervasive and dangerous than physical domination
- dominant narrative locks the non-European subject into a Western world view.
- Indigenous: (sic) people as ‘the other’ as
‘untouchable’, ‘savage’, native, ‘the blacks’.
