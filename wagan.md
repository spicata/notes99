- fracture old notions of the nation,
- to read the February 2008 Federal Parliament Apology to the Stolen Generations as one such negotiation between many local voices and concerns, and the idea of the modern nation as it looks ‘outwards’ to the global, acutely aware of and needing to respond to its global affiliations and responsibilities.
- patently different to Birch’s, more apocalyptic, but it has the same kinds of locatedness: this stretch which is ‘in my blood’, ‘this stretch of road…this stretch’; the local as the particular, the familiar and the intimately understood.
- Watson places the ancient and the contemporary ... violently up against each other.
- does not begin on a national stage, or in the use of universalising speakers. In different ways their poetry is necessarily entrenched in the local: intimate voices, places, knowledges.
- this contemporary poetry is located, questioning, still needing to remember the woundedness of the past.
- ‘colonisation of the mind’ is more pervasive and dangerous than physical domination
- dominant narrative locks the non-European subject into a Western world view.
- Indigenous: (sic) people as ‘the other’ as
‘untouchable’, ‘savage’, native, ‘the blacks’.
- go beyond the linear historical model of colonisation and view
it in a post-structuralist context.
- Postcolonial theorists and writers also
advance the creation of new hybrid spaces in-between, in which other identities beyond the colonial
binaries might be found. ‘Cultural identities are both fragmented and in a constant state of flux’
- ‘colonial empires both fear and engender biological as well as
intellectual hybridities’
- also serves to
highlight Watson’s hybridity and the politics of being urban, Aboriginal.
- In the loose-limbed structure of the verse, its minimal punctuation and fluid rhythms, the power of anger and loss slowly mounts in the surreal 'dingo longue'. The anger is directed against systemic degradation, instituionalisation, technological and capitalist horrors
- Watson addresses a double past, a double ontology. ... there is the past of oppression and the past of land, dignity, custom, storytelling, song.
- ... but there is equally a gothic, macabre imagination at work
- These poem reclaim memory as sacred process: first the remembering, then the willingness to listen and to act.
- He clear-sightedly and prophetically depicts the psychic, spiritual and physical payments being made by Aboriginal Australians. But as well as the protests of such representations, Watson calls for a clear-sighted and listening response — not least from his readers — to the lives and dreams of contemporary urban Aboriginal Australians.
