Things to consider:
* colonisation is a very recent event. What were the other concerns that the Indigenous had before colonialism happened?
* Diversity of Indigenous experience (it's not only trauma)

* Stolen generation is the generation of Indigenous people that were forcibly taken out of their own homes.

> I have no identity, really

> My mother did not bond with her mother and I did not bond with mine

> We never heard the words 'I love you', so we never learned to say them to our family

> I was hurting and had found no way of safely healing the pain

If you can't verbalise something to other people, then you can't interalise it yourself. As you (I) know, what you can name you can control.

## Civilisation

Dr Margaret Mead: The first sign of a civilisation was compassion and selflessness, and that would be a 15,000 year old healed femur. Someone took care of an injured person, putting their own life on the side.

On the other hand: There is a 40,000 to 42,000 yo skeleton, which was the first clear example of cremation and burying. Somone cared enough to make sure that someone truly cared enough to someone to even tend to them and ensure a process was followed long after their death.

## religion

* Song lines are geographical, astronomical, logistical, spiritual, narrative maps (stories and songs, mostly spoken)
* Part of "lore" training i.e. growing up and maturing, like a bora ring
* This is the Australia's "Book of Genesis"

I hope this is not a dead link

These songlines are very important to not only Indigenous history, but to Australia's history as a whole. Argued that it should be taught at school. For example: the seven sisters from Greek mythology (Zeus amiright) compared to Indigenous seven sisters --- a great coincidence.

In the song line, the sisters themselves just ascends to the heavens, and the man they are carrying (because he is dead), becomes Orion. So how come they are treated on such different levels? 

Eventually, the stories that we tell become engrained into our identities.
