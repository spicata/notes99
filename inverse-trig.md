- secT = 1/cosT
- cosecT = 1/sinT
- cotT = 1/tanT = cosT/sinT

```
cos T       1             
-----  >  ----- (e.g. T = 180deg; compare answers)
sin T     tan T           
```

If you divide the Pythagorean identity by cos^2 T, then you get 1 + tan^2 T = sec^2 T. On the other hand, if you divide it by sin^2 T, hen you get cot^2 T + 1 = csc^2 T.
