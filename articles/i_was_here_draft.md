*An article about having been here.*

## part 0: hands

In the expansive plateaus of Santa Cruz, there exists a cave: Cueve de las Manos. Uncovered in the 1940s, it provides evidence of early South American hunter-gather groups from between 7,300 BCE and 700 CE. It is nor preserved as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

And in that cave, there are hand-prints. There are around a thousand of these hand-prints from culture past.

## part 1: graffiti

~~Graffiti is something you never happen to see in the making. One day, there is a plain wall. The next, a completed mural. Sometimes just a name, other times some artwork.~~

> "My name is..."

Tags, slaps, throw-ups, and pieces. Graffiti is something that just kind of seems to appear one day. You just walk down the road one day and think: "Huh, was that always there?" On abandoned buildings, on traffic light poles, and in random alleys.

Names, monikers, and initials. These are the artefacts left behind. They transform barren and run-down walls into places where hot-spots of stories and names.

## part 2: i love you, 'i love you'

On popular tourist attractions, you'll often find messages such as "AB + XY". Sometimes, a heart around it too. At other places, are the locks inscribed with people names, their keys thrown away into the ocean.

These are messages that will likely long outlive the people who wrote them. Whether it be a falling out between the two people which leaves obsolete or just time itself, these messages remain. An eternal testament of love. Well, until someone walks in with a fresh bucket of paint.

A very culturally significant example of this is 'i love you will you marry me', a message painted onto a bridge in the Sheffield Park Hills housing estate.

## part 3: untold

These fragments that strangers leave behind are just that. Fragments of a larger story. The history of hundreds of generations of individuals. The life of those who plan, paint, and plant signs. The tale of couples, partners, and friends.

These stories will never be fully told nor documented. All we have are the imprints they have left behind in the world. The rest is up to imagination.

Perhaps it is best these stories, and the characters go unknown, anonymous.

## part end: i was here

"i was here". A message embodying something intensely human. Something people leave behind for others to find. A little breadcrumb trail.

It is so many messages at once. "i was here first". "look at my accomplishment". "look at my friends". "don't forget me".

These are messages that outlive memories, lives, and societies.
