Inspired by [another article by tacoz](https://nottacoz.github.io/jacaranda/articles/What-500-Days-At-The-Gym-Taught-Me-About-Self-Growth)

Okay it turns out that i've drawn around 260 xobs, give or take a few (just in case you don't know what xobs are, [check out the website](https://xob.99000000.xyz)). So, what have i learnt from drawing that many xobs.

Whimsy? That's a word that a *certain member of the town uses often*. If you take everything to seriously, it makes it harder to actually enjoy it. That kind of ended up creating the xob drought of 2023 (lol, all of it was 2023).

Same kind of things happens everywhere else too. For example, the articles section of spicata99 (now its more of a blog) suffered from taking it too seriously. Of course, there are some advantages of this. It made me think about the articles I actually post a bit more. But also it took away some of the fun and whimsy of it, as Loren pointed out.

Of course, I'm completely okay when that happens to articles (for now). But xobs are meant to be this funny little thing.

So yeah, be less serious about xobs. It's more fun that way.
