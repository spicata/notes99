The mayor's job is to be admin on the Town discord server.

Do:
- ask for permission
- make changes when it would benefit the server
- moderate sometimes
- moderate when there is also a public outrage
- etc

Don't (even if for a 'joke'):
- change other person's nickname
- mute people
- delete messages
- kick/ban people
- remove people from a call
- delete channels
- give admin to your friends

Don't follow the rules, and get removed from power (or if 75% of the members dislike your rule).

We will elect a new mayor every quarter ([approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)) (or when one gets smote). Election period will be 3 days long.
