      <h1 class="title">pitch meeting 2: discord but better</h1>
      
      <p>Idea: Imagine an chatting/communication app like Discord. Now imagine that, when you log in, the system says something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>M.spicata</strong> has logged in. Say hi!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in channels you want.</p>

<p>Why: Well, firstly, when you meet your friend in real life, you don’t just silently approach them and then wait for them to say something. Secondly, it is just kind of nice. In IRC (an older protocol), when you log in, it does in fact say “M.spicata logged in”, and then people will say hi, which is nice.</p>

<p>Thirdly, having like a “just logged in” and a “log out” announcement gives definite bounds to your session. So that you don’t stay on for too long.</p>

<p>“But, just use IRC.” IRC sucks. As much as I adore previous protocols and things, I simply dislike IRC. Discord and co. are so much more convenient.</p>

<p>“But, I don’t want people to see when I log in.” Fair, so there should be a system like being invisible on Discord, where your existence is unannounced.</p>

<p>“But, I only want to show up on certain servers.” Just make like a toggle thing whether a server gets the introductions. Public servers default to “no introduction”, and private ones default to “introduction” (maybe). Also make it enable-able on DM groups.</p>
