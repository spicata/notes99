Hyun's Dojo is a group of tons of different animators. In December, they are going to be holding a tournament to decide who is the best animator among them, for which I am quite hyped.

So, uh, here are some of my favourite animators from the Dojo:
- Gildedguy
- Hyun
- MicroMist
- TJB
- Hatena360
- CatGod

Would be amazing if any of these creators end up as 'The Chosen One'. But of course, I would be very happy no matter the result of the tournament. Cheers to the best animator.
