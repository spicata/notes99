Please, for the love of god, stop integrating smart things into houses. You get this thing that is already working perfectly, and adding so much overhead. Things that will break so much easier, and will be so much harder to fix.

Mechanical systems work best, and then electrical systems when mechanical is inconvenient. Please please please never use digital systems. I don't need a door that will save me the effort of opening it. I need a door that will work no matter what, whether the power cuts out or it isn't on the newest version. I want lights that I can switch on, not ones that won't work if the WiFi is down. I want lights that work even if the company supporting them goes out of business and has to shutdown their servers.

Mechanical and electrical systems are reliable and understandable. The average person might not understand the ins and outs of these systems, but they can grasp it. And usually, the light-bulb is the problem. Where do you start if the light switch on your phone is not working?

Also, mechanical systems are tactile. A light switch has a clear click. You push a door. Since they are already tactile, you don't need to add haptics. How nice is that.
