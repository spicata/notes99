      <p>sigh.</p>

<p>over the past 5 years, i’ve been able to meet lots of different people. i’ve been able to make new friends, and have lots of different experiences with them. but to think that this is coming to an end soon… it’s strange.</p>

<p>while we were here, it felt like it would always be like this. this would change, sure, but they were just little things. graduating seemed so far away, and the stability of high school would seem eternal, at least for now. though now, i sit and can see the end in front of me. i’m not there yet, not quite, but i can see it.</p>

<p>does change scare me? i think it does. who knows what lies on the other side of that line. will the friendships i’ve made along the way stay standing once i pass it? or will it slowly erode away?</p>

<p>/shrug</p>

<p>i kind of wish it will all stay this way, forever. the childhood fantasy of eternity. but i know that’s not gonna happen. one can wish though, can’t they.</p>

<p>if there’s one thing i want from year 12, it’s that i end up doing more with my friends. i don’t have much expectations for the future <span class="small-date">(much to my parent’s dismay)</span class="small-date">.</p>
