## part 0: hands

Humans, or at least Homo Sapiens, have been around 300 000 years. We began to show what we could describe as 'humanness' somewhere between 160 000 to 70 000 years ago. Since then, we've had family, culture, and eventually, society. For 70 000 years of humans, like you and I, have roamed the Earth.

In the 1940s, we found a cave in the expansive plateaus of Santa Cruz. A cave where humans, from around 6 000 years ago, lived. A cave new preserved as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This was Cueva de las Manos, the Cave of the Hands. And as expected, in that cave were hands, printed onto the wall. Hundreds of these hands from humans long past. A final echo of their existence and a testament of our collective desire to leave something behind.

## part 1: graffiti

Tags, slaps, throw-ups, and pieces. Graffiti has made a name for itself, especially in the urban environments where they thrive. In New South Wales, there were over 40 000 **reported** cases of graffiti (New South Wales is in Australia, for anyone who doesn't know. It is *totally* the state I live in). Whether you think it is vandalism or art, it's here.

Times have very much changed from 6 000 years ago. But even in the concrete jungles of today, people still try to leave behind a mark.  Graffiti is to cities what cave-paintings were to caves. They transform the environments that we live in. From caves to buildings. A mark, a name, or a moniker; these are the artefacts of the modern world. A time may come where this is all that is left in an empty and desolate city.

Graffiti lends itself to this. Other visual arts are limited by paper and cloth. Music is fleeting at best. Sculpture is expensive and difficult. Graffiti is permanent (sort of) and public. Anywhere accessible wall, surface, or crevice is a place where graffiti can thrive.

We leave a lot more that names sprayed onto walls. A small walk around the general area you live might lead you to finding a little "AB + XY" message somewhere: a tourist attraction, a tree, or some random table. These are everywhere. In other places, there are padlocks with their keys cast into the ocean. These are semi-permanent fixtures of our environment, and if left by themselves will long outlive the people who put it there. An eternal testament of love. Well, until someone walks in with a fresh bucket of paint.

## part 3: untold

A very culturally significant example of this is 'i love you will you marry me', a message painted onto a bridge in the Sheffield Park Hills housing estate.

These fragments that strangers leave behind are just that. Fragments of a larger story. The history of hundreds of generations of individuals. The life of those who plan, paint, and plant signs. The tale of couples, partners, and friends.

These stories will never be fully told nor documented. All we have are the imprints they have left behind in the world. The rest is up to imagination.

Perhaps it is best these stories, and the characters go unknown, anonymous.

## part end: i was here

"i was here". A message embodying something intensely human. Something people leave behind for others to find. A little breadcrumb trail.

It is so many messages at once. "i was here first". "look at my accomplishment". "look at my friends". "don't forget me".

These are messages that outlive memories, lives, and societies.
