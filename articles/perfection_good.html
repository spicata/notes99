    <h1>perfection vs good</h1>

      <p>Perfection is the enemy of good. This is an adage that has been echoed throughout time, so why is it so hard to avoid perfection anyways?</p>

<p>It always seems like — even though you <strong>know</strong> that having anything on a page, or an article, or just a minecraft base is best — I always fall into the trap of trying to perfect. I know you do too.</p>

<p>Kind of weird how that always ends up happening…</p>

<p>There’s ways around it, of course. There is the method of writing drunk and editing sober. Just get everything you are thinking onto a page, then edit from there. That method is a little exhausting at times though, and getting thoughts into words are sometimes difficult. I guess just writing them is the point though, it doesn’t really need to make sense. It’s taxing,</p>

<p>From there, it’s just constant revision, unless you end up liking the first revision. That’s very unlikely though.</p>

<p>You could also stop worrying, I guess. That’s also a solution.</p>

<p>On a similar note, there is also the 80-20 rule, where 20% of things gives 80% of the results. The last 20% is always the hardest. Maybe we need to settle for mediocrity. But that eventually leads to stagnation.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Anyways that’s the end. There was no real good way to end this one, and there aren’t really any better solutions I can  offer. Maybe I come up with examples of good getting in the way of perfection. I may not. Who knows.</p>

<p>I’ll let you know if I ever find a solution.</p>
