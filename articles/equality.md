title: equality != similarity

A conversation I had.

A: That article is saying that in an structure of equality, more differences emerge and then going on to say that 'this' is bad. It's implying we should implement structural inequality.

B: No it's not. It's saying that people are inherently different, and hence it is wrong to make them the same in the structure of quote unquote equality.

A: But equality doesn't need similarity. People can be different and still be equals.

B: What are you talking about? **Equality means similarity!** People can't truly be equals, they are all different!

A: ... What?

I'm pretty sure B was wrong.
