I wished to find a reason for which they spent hours on end hanging about in digital space — but the answer lay simply in the fact that *there didn’t have to be a reason*. “Physical spaces are dead” one student told me, who was studying city-making and community at a new kind of university sprung up within the cozyverse, “go to starbucks, or your local coffeeshop for example — everyone is there for a reason: to pick up their coffee and go, to meet with a particular person, to work silently on their laptop, and so on…” he continued, “contrast this to bars and coffeeshops of old — even 30 years back people would visit their local coffeeshop or bar for the simple reason that they might bump into friends, or other likeminded people who frequented the space. In essence, people were open to serendipity. Today they are not.”  \n> ...  \n> “Exactly,” said the student, “paradoxically, people need to actually communicate _less_ with each other to develop more natural friendships over time. With the advent of smartphones, people began to coordinate every meeting, and every detail of their lives. Our technology stifled serendipity.” \"  \n> \\- Alzen Elza — [Cozyverse Traveller](https://azlen.me/stories/cozyverse-traveller/)\n\nPeople don't organise their meetings on picnic table red. Nobody goes \"we should get on call at 9 o'clock\". That is simply not how it works. One person sits at the table, then more come. Slowly at first, unless there is a guest. Others will leave, only to come back. Some sit silently, only there for that sense of camaraderie, knowing that there are others there too.\n\nThis is how picnic table red grows. This is how the Town had grown. ","x":-3040,"y":-720,"width":320,"height":609,"color":"1"},
