> A snap election may be initiated at any time, but after a snap election fails the mayor gains a 5 day immunity. 3 successive failed snap election results in a 1 month immunity. This requires 1 person to challenge the mayor, with the support of at least 4 other people. Following this, the members of the town will participate in a vote between the challenger and the mayor. The challenger must get a strict majority (> 50%, absentees are considered votes for the current mayor). If this is attained, the mayor must hand over ownership to the challenger.

## Point 1: Not Failed

Snap election 2 was cancelled by Jonathan, but it did not fail. Thus, Edward is not to be afforded with a 5 day immunity, as the vote did not fail.

## Point 2: Practices

Snap election 3 could be argued to not have been done in the best way possible. However, nowhere in the bill does it state in what way the snap election needs to be done, and it only states that everyone must do it. Additionally, this method of doing it was done in order to prevent the speaker from unconstitutionally cancelling a snap vote, even if there is majority in favour.
