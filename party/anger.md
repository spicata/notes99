I have reached a point at which I can no longer take it. Edward has had a very brief rule, and with this time, he has already turned me (who once believed he would be able to unite the town) against him.

My very first point of contention is his constant suppression of speech. Even under my rule, which most would agree to be undemocratic, I did not rule unconstitutionally. I did not mute those who opposed me and those who criticised me. I would let them go, albeit with a little warning. Under Ed's rule, I have already seen so many cases where he would mute people on A WHIM. Where he will silence the Town's people. Silence My people, My friends. The very people we worked together with to create a town.

He'd silence Dasindu for failing to UNDERSTAND A JOKE, would silence Taj and Tom for posting pictures of him, and he would silence me in VC as A JOKE. Is this tyrant the person you voted for? Is this rule the one that you wanted? A rule where you have to look out for what you say in case an increasingly sensitive and fragile dictator were to silence you? A rule where you would need to stay by him or get antagonised?

We voted because we thought Edward would bring PEACE back into the server, but instead he fragmented it by imposing arbitrary rules and he seems to intend to do it by silencing those who oppose him.

But what really pushed me over the edge is when he ALLOWED, maybe even SUPPORTED Jonathan to cancel a snap election against him with the justification that "everyone is too busy", when in fact there was a MAJORITY that would have voted for the Party Party. He ALLOWED a vote that would have put him out of power to be cancelled.

This cannot be reiterated enough. Under what exceptional circumstance would a snap election ever be cancelled. Unless the world is on the edge of demise, an election should not be cancelled. And it especially should not be SUPPORTED by the people it would depose.
