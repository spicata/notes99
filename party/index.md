"Thomas", the mascot of the Party Party

The Party Party is *the* political party for the town. I hope to unite all members of the town under one unified banners, so that we may all grow together, instead of continuously fighting each other to claw for power, and to push our ideas. In essence, what we just want to do is to sit back and relax; the Town should not be this political battleground, it should be this chill place where we can hang out.

## A Party is Party

Our first --- and original --- policy was that, if I were to get elected into mayoship, we will hold a party (preferably after our exams are done). Maybe a putt party, who knows. But we will hold a party, because I believe that, not only should we celebrate the Town, but also it's a nice fun activity we can all enjoy.

I think it'll be fun. And I think it will be nice too.

((i mean to celebrate by this. i bet half of us are too lazy to go outside.))

## A Party for Progress

I also believe that, under both Edward's rules and Shan-mei's rule, not much progress has been made. They both said that they would install big changes, but nothing much has happened. 

I am not like them. I am radical (and a little mad), so I will bring about quite a few new changes around the block. Luckily, none of them will really change your day to day life in the town, but they will probably change a few things quite drastically.

Chief among them is a new immigration policy. Under Shan-mei's rule, we got an immigration policy that requires a majority vote, which, in my opinion, will stifle the growth of the Town. However, under the old system of just letting them in, the Town will end up 'overpopulating' of sorts, especially with how the growth of the Town seems to be exponential (sort of).

### The New Immigration Policy

You need just two people to back you in order to join the Town. It is that simple, just 2. In case you need help, one of these people will be tasked with helping you set up your website, and the other person (preferably more experienced) will supervise. Everything will (hopefully) be dealt with within this system of helpers.

## A Party of People

Parties, as you know, is not a party if there are no people in the Party. This goes for both ðŸ¥³ parties and ðŸ«… parties. And so, the most important part of a party are the people within it. I said that I wanted to unite the Town under one banner, and so, if you agree with these policies, feel free to join the party. Just send me a direct message, and welcome to the bigger Party Party. Hopefully, we can get everyone to agree in this Party.

Additionally, because the most important part of a party are the people, I want to hear your opinions. Because, unlike some political parties, I know and care for the people that will be influenced by the actions of the party.

## A Party of Peace

Finally, the Party Party (I hope) will bring a general peace to the server. A calmness, because some of us really do need to just calm down (myself included). Unless you really want, the Party Party will operate in the background, trying not to disturb the members of the Town. Like Oscar. He doesn't like getting pinged. I will try not to ping you unless absolutely nessecary Oscar. Or maybe for a game of YOMI hustle. :-)

## Conclusion

Unlike Edward's (and sort of my) campaign, the Party campaign will not be built on rashness and plotting and couping. Just the want to have fun and peace (maybe a grain of annoyance).

It would once again be nice to bring the Town back into an era of peace, where we don't need to fear about political uprising, or we wouldn't get a poll to complete every other day, or where we need to fear an admin muting us in vc. 

This is what the Party Party wishes to do. We want to Party, and we to have Peace (as well as some progress). And if you agree, the best way to ensure that would be to vote for the Party Party. In most organisations, your votes don't really matter, but in the Town, a single vote counts for 6.25% of the entire vote, which is quite a substantial amount.

Every vote for peace and party counts.
