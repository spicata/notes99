The Party Party ðŸŽŠðŸŽŠðŸŽŠ (led by me) is a new (the first?) political party of the town!

Here are our policies that we will enact if we get voted in:

- We will have a party when we get voted in. If we get voted in before the exams finish, we'll wait till the exams finish.

That is our only policy.
