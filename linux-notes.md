- Shells: zsh, bash, fish, etc
- Terminal (emulators): built-in, alacritty, kitty, cool retro term, etc

Distros have a desktop environments (DE) built in. DE acts as a way to create GUI, in order to interact with a computer without the need to depend on CLI. Examples include:
- XCFE
- [Gnome](gnome)
- Cinnamon
- KDE plasma
- LXDE

Different distros will be able to support different DEs. Mint comes with Cinnamon, Ubuntu with Gnome, Pop_OS! with Pantheon (from elementary OS).

DE includes window manager, panel, file manager, etc. Window manages windows. On Linux systems, this is normally X11 (X). X11 uses twm by default, but other window managers run on X. For example, Awesome. Awesome is a tiling windows manager. Instead of being able to layer them, you can only tile them. Think `Super+Y`.

`Super` is sometimes called `Mod4`, short for modifier key 4.

Distros are different distributions/types/flavours of Linux. Some are children of others. Example:
- Arch...
    - Manjaro
    - Gentoo
- Debian...
    - Ubuntu...
        - Linux Mint
- Red Hat...
    - Fedora

Distros come with a package manager, something that handles downloads of application and such. Debian-Ubuntu uses APT. Arch uses Pacman. Keep eye out for them, will change based on the distro.
